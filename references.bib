@article{Kierczak2021,
abstract = {Despite the success in identifying effects of common genetic variants, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), much of the genetic contribution to complex traits remains unexplained. Here, we analysed high coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, to evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variants to 414 plasma proteins. The frequency distribution of genetic variants was skewed towards the rare spectrum, and damaging variants were more often rare. However, only 2.24{\%} of the heritability was estimated to be explained by rare variants. A gene-based approach, developed to also capture the effect of rare variants, identied associations for 249 of the proteins, which was 25{\%} more as compared to a GWAS. Out of those, 24 associations were driven by rare variants, clearly highlighting the capacity of aggregated tests and WGS data. We conclude that, while many rare variants have considerable phenotypic effects, their contribution to the missing heritability is limited by their low frequencies.},

abstract = {The female reproductive system contains two principal components: the uterus, which supports the developing fetus, and the ovaries, which produce the female gametes. This manuscript will review how the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary and uterus are integrated into the female reproductive system. The endocrinology of pregnancy, as well as a cursory overview of reproductive pathology, will be presented in each section. In addition, the most common endocrinopathy in women, polycystic ovarian syndrome, as well as the early loss of reproductive function, premature ovarian failure, will receive special mention. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

@article{Hess1997b,
abstract = {Oestrogen is considered to be the 'female' hormone, whereas testosterone is considered the 'male' hormone. However, both hormones are present in both sexes. Thus sexual distinctions are not qualitative differences, but rather result from quantitative divergence in hormone concentrations and differential expressions of steroid hormone receptors. In males, oestrogen is present in low concentrations in blood, but can be extraordinarily high in semen, and as high as 250 pg ml-1 in rete testis fluids, which is higher than serum oestradiol in the female. It is well known that male reproductive tissues express oestrogen receptors, but the role of oestrogen in male reproduction has remained unclear. Here we provide evidence of a physiological role for oestrogen in male reproductive organs. We show that oestrogen regulates the reabsorption of luminal fluid in the head of the epididymis. Disruption of this essential function causes sperm to enter the epididymis diluted, rather than concentrate, resulting in infertility. This finding raises further concern over the potential direct effects of environmental oestrogens on male reproduction and reported declines in human sperm counts.},

abstract = {Many enzymes catalyse reactions that have an oestrogen as a substrate and/or a product. The reactions catalysed include aromatisation, oxidation, reduction, sulfonation, desulfonation, hydroxylation and methoxylation. The enzymes that catalyse these reactions must all recognise and bind oestrogen but, despite this, they have diverse structures. This review looks at each of these enzymes in turn, describing the structure and discussing the mechanism of the catalysed reaction. Since oestrogen has a role in many disease states inhibition of the enzymes of oestrogen metabolism may have an impact on the state or progression of the disease and inhibitors of these enzymes are briefly discussed.
