abstract = {Despite the success in identifying effects of common genetic variants, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), much of the genetic contribution to complex traits remains unexplained. Here, we analysed high coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, to evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variants to 414 plasma proteins. The frequency distribution of genetic variants was skewed towards the rare spectrum, and damaging variants were more often rare. However, only 2.24{\%} of the heritability was estimated to be explained by rare variants. A gene-based approach, developed to also capture the effect of rare variants, identied associations for 249 of the proteins, which was 25{\%} more as compared to a GWAS. Out of those, 24 associations were driven by rare variants, clearly highlighting the capacity of aggregated tests and WGS data. We conclude that, while many rare variants have considerable phenotypic effects, their contribution to the missing heritability is limited by their low frequencies.},
