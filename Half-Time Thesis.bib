abstract = {Results: Variants in/near CYP19A1 demonstrated the strongest evidence for association with E2, resolving to three independent signals. Two additional independent signals were found on the X chromosome; FAMily with sequence similarity 9, member B (FAM9B), rs5934505 (P = 3.4 3 1028) and Xq27.3, rs5951794 (P = 3.1 3 10210). E1 signals were found in CYP19A1 (rs2899472, P = 5.5 3 10223), in Tripartite motif containing 4 (TRIM4; rs17277546, P = 5.8 3 10214), and CYP11B1/B2 (rs10093796, P = 1.2 3 1028). E2 signals in CYP19A1 and FAM9B were associated with bone mineral density (BMD). Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of serum E2 on BMD in men. A 1 pg/mL genetically increased E2 was associated with a 0.048 standard deviation increase in lumbar spine BMD (P = 2.8 3 10212). In men and women combined, CYP19A1 alleles associated with higher E2 levels were associated with lower degrees of insulin resistance. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that CYP19A1 is an important genetic regulator of E2 and E1 levels and strengthen the causal importance of E2 for bone health in men. We also report two independent loci on the X-chromosome for E2, and one locus each in TRIM4 and CYP11B1/B2, for E1.},

abstract = {We performed a discovery genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with variation in plasma estradiol (E2) concentrations using DNA from 772 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer prior to the initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy. Association analyses showed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1864729) with the lowest P value (P = 3.49E-08), mapped to chromosome 8 near TSPYL5. We also identified 17 imputed SNPs in or near TSPYL5 with P values {\textless} 5E-08, one of which, rs2583506, created a functional estrogen response element. We then used a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) stably transfected with ER$\alpha$ with known genome-wide SNP genotypes to demonstrate that TSPYL5 expression increased after E2 exposure of cells heterozygous for variant TSPYL5 SNP genotypes, but not in those homozygous for wild-type alleles. TSPYL5 knockdown decreased, and overexpression increased aromatase (CYP19A1) expression in MCF-7 cells, LCLs, and adipocytes through the skin/adipose (I.4) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that TSPYL5 bound to the CYP19A1 I.4 promoter. A putative TSPYL5 binding motif was identified in 43 genes, and TSPYL5 appeared to function as a transcription factor for most of those genes. In summary, genome-wide significant SNPs in TSPYL5 were associated with elevated plasma E2 in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. SNP rs2583506 created a functional estrogen response element, and LCLs with variant SNP genotypes displayed increased E2-dependent TSPYL5 expression. TSPYL5 induced CYP19A1 expression and that of many other genes. These studies have revealed a novel mechanism for regulating aromatase expression and plasma E2 concentrations in postmenopausal women with ER(+) breast cancer.},

abstract = {We propose here a new unitary model for the pathophysiology of involutional osteoporosis that identifies estrogen (E) deficiency as the cause of both the early, accelerated and the late, slow phases of bone loss in postmenopausal women and as a contributing cause of the continuous phase of bone loss in aging men. The accelerated phase in women is most apparent during the first decade after menopause, involves disproportionate loss of cancellous bone, and is mediated mainly by loss of the direct restraining effects of E on bone cell function. The ensuing slow phase continues throughout life in women, involves proportionate losses of cancellous and cortical bone, and is associated with progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism. This phase is mediated mainly by loss of E action on extraskeletal calcium homeostasis which results in net calcium wasting and increases in the level of dietary calcium intake required to maintain bone balance. Because elderly men have low circulating levels of both bioavailable E and bioavailable testosterone (T) and because recent data suggest that E is at least as important as T in determining bone mass in aging men, E deficiency may also contribute substantially to the continuous bone loss of aging men. In both genders, E deficiency increases bone resorption and may also impair a compensatory increase in bone formation. For the most part, this unitary model is well supported by observational and experimental data and provides plausible explanations to traditional objections to a unitary hypothesis.},

abstract = {Context. Estradiol is the primary female sex hormone and plays an important role for skeletal health in both sexes. Several enzymes are involved in estradiol metabolism but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to characterize the genetic contribution to variation in estrogen levels. Objective. Identify genetic loci affecting estradiol levels and estimate causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD). Design. We performed GWAS for estradiol in males (N = 147,690) and females (N = 163,985) from UK Biobank (UKB). Estradiol was analyzed as a binary phenotype; above/below detection limit (175 pmol/L). We further estimated the causal effect of estradiol on BMD using Mendelian randomization. Results. We identified 14 independent loci associated (P{\&}lt;5x10-8) with estradiol levels in males, of which one (CYP3A7) was genome-wide and seven nominally (P{\&}lt;0.05) significant in females. In addition, one female specific locus was identified. Most loci contain functionally relevant genes that have not been discussed in relation to estradiol levels in previous GWAS. For example, SRD5A2, which encodes a steroid 5-alpha reductase that is involved in processing androgens, and UGT3A1 and UGT2B7 which encode enzymes likely to be involved in estradiol elimination. The allele that tags the O blood group, at the ABO locus, was associated with higher estradiol levels. We identified a causal effect of high estradiol levels on increased BMD in both males (P=1.58x10-11) and females (P=7.48x10-6). Conclusion. Our findings further support the importance of the body{\&}{\#}039;s own estrogen to maintain skeletal health in males and in females.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe research was funded by the Swedish Research Council ({\AA}.J), the cancer foundation ({\AA}.J), the brain foundation ({\AA}.J), the {\AA} Wiberg (W.E.E), M Borgstr{\"{o}}m (W.E.E), Hedstr{\"{o}}ms, K och O F (W.E.E), A and M Rudbergs (W.E.E) foundations.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:UKB has an ethics permit from the National Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 11 / NW / 0382).

@article{Vikan2010,
abstract = {Objective: To study the impact of endogenous sex hormone levels in community-dwelling men on later risk for type 2 diabetes. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. Methods: For the analyses, 1454 men who participated in the fourth Troms{\o} study (1994-1995) were used. Cases of diabetes were retrieved and validated until 31.12.05 following a detailed protocol. The prospective association between sex hormones and diabetes was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, allowing for multivariate adjustments. Results: There was a significantly lowered multi-adjusted risk for later diabetes with higher normal total testosterone levels, both linearly per S.D. increase (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.92) and in the higher quartiles of total testosterone than in the lowest quartiles (HR 0.53, CI 0.33-0.84). A reduced multi-adjusted risk for incident diabetes was also found for men with higher sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, both linearly per S.D. increase (HR 0.55, CI 0.39-0.79) and when comparing the third (HR 0.38, CI 0.18-0.81) and the fourth quartile (HR 0.37, CI 0.17-0.82) to the lowest quartile. The associations with total testosterone and SHBG were no longer significant after inclusion of waist circumference to the multivariate models. Estradiol (E2) was positively associated with incident diabetes after multivariate adjustments including waist circumference when comparing the second (HR 0.49, CI 0.26-0.93) and the third (HR 0.51, CI 0.27-0.96) quartile to the highest quartile. Conclusion: Men with higher E2 levels had an increased risk of later diabetes independent of obesity, while men with lower total testosterone and SHBG had an increased risk of diabetes that appeared to be dependent on obesity. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Society of Endocrinology.},

abstract = {Testosterone supplementation is commonly used for its effects on sexual function, bone health and body composition, yet its effects on disease outcomes are unknown. To better understand this, we identified genetic determinants of testosterone levels and related sex hormone traits in 425,097 UK Biobank study participants. Using 2,571 genome-wide significant associations, we demonstrate that the genetic determinants of testosterone levels are substantially different between sexes and that genetically higher testosterone is harmful for metabolic diseases in women but beneficial in men. For example, a genetically determined 1 s.d. higher testosterone increases the risks of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 (95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 1.22–1.53)) and polycystic ovary syndrome (OR = 1.51 (95{\%} CI: 1.33–1.72)) in women, but reduces type 2 diabetes risk in men (OR = 0.86 (95{\%} CI: 0.76–0.98)). We also show adverse effects of higher testosterone on breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. Our findings provide insights into the disease impacts of testosterone and highlight the importance of sex-specific genetic analyses. Genetic analysis of data from over 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank Study shows that circulating testosterone levels have sex-specific implications for cardiometabolic diseases and cancer outcomes.},

abstract = {Context Observational studies indicate that serum estradiol (E2) is more strongly associated with bone mineral density (BMD) than serum testosterone (T) is, whereas both E2 and T associate with fracture risk in men. Objective To evaluate the possible causal effect of serum E2 and T on fracture risk in men. Design, Setting, and Participants A Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was undertaken using individual-level data on genotypes, BMD as estimated by quantitative ultrasound of the heel (eBMD), fractures (n = 17,650), and relevant covariates of 175,583 unrelated men of European origin from the UK Biobank. The genetic instruments for serum E2 and T were taken from the most recent large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analyses on these hormones in men. Results MR analyses demonstrated a causal effect of serum E2 on eBMD and fracture risk. A 1 SD (or 9.6 pg/mL) genetically instrumented decrease in serum E2 levels was associated with a 0.38 SD decrease in eBMD (P value: 9.7 × 10 -74) and an increased risk of any fracture (OR: 1.35; 95{\%} CI: 1.18, 1.55), nonvertebral major osteoporotic fractures (OR: 1.75; 95{\%} CI: 1.35, 2.27), and wrist fractures (OR: 2.27; 95{\%} CI: 1.62, 3.16). These causal effects of serum E2 levels on fracture risk were robust in sensitivity analyses and remained unchanged in stratified analyses for age, body mass index, eBMD, smoking status, and physical activity. MR analyses revealed no evidence of a causal effect of T levels on fracture risk. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence of a robust causal effect of serum E2, but not T, on fracture risk in men.},

@article{Cauley1999a,
abstract = {Background: The relation between endogenous steroid hormones and risk for breast cancer is uncertain. Measurement of sex hormone levels may identify women at high risk for breast cancer who should consider preventive therapies. Objective: To test the hypothesis that serum concentrations of estradiol and testosterone predict risk for breast cancer. Design: Prospective case-cohort study. Setting: Four clinical centers in the United States. Participants: 97 women with confirmed incident breast cancer and 244 randomly selected controls; all women were white, 65 years of age or older, and were not receiving estrogen. Measurements: Sex-steroid hormone concentrations were assayed by using serum that was collected at baseline and stored at -190 °C. Risk factors for breast cancer were ascertained by questionnaire. Incident cases of breast cancer were confirmed by review of medical records during an average period of 3.2 years. Results: The relative risk for breast cancer in women with the highest concentration of bioavailable estradiol (≥6.83 pmol/L or 1.9 pg/mL) was 3.6 (95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 10.0) compared with women with the lowest concentration. The risk for breast cancer in women with the highest concentration of free testosterone compared with those with the lowest concentration was 3.3 (CI, 1.1 to 10.3). The estimated incidence of breast cancer per 1000 person-years was 0.4 (CI, 0.0 to 1.3) in women with the lowest levels of bioavailable estradiol and free testosterone compared with 6.5 (CI, 2.7 to 10.3) in women with the highest concentrations of these hormones. Traditional risk factors for breast cancer were similar in case-patients and controls. Adjustments for these risk factors had little effect on the results. Conclusions: Estradiol and testosterone levels may play important roles in the development of breast cancer in older women. A single measurement of bioavailable estradiol and free testosterone may be used to estimate a woman's risk for breast cancer. Women identified as being at high risk for breast cancer as determined by these hormone levels may benefit from antiestrogen treatment for primary prevention.},

Here, we analysed high coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, to evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variants to 414 plasma proteins. The frequency distribution of genetic variants was skewed towards the rare spectrum, and damaging variants were more often rare. However, only 2.24{\%} of the heritability was estimated to be explained by rare variants. A gene-based approach, developed to also capture the effect of rare variants, identied associations for 249 of the proteins, which was 25{\%} more as compared to a GWAS. Out of those, 24 associations were driven by rare variants, clearly highlighting the capacity of aggregated tests and WGS data. We conclude that, while many rare variants have considerable phenotypic effects, their contribution to the missing heritability is limited by their low frequencies.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants that contribute to breast cancer risk. Discovering additional variants has become difficult, as power to detect variants of weaker effect with present sample sizes is limited. An alternative approach is to look for variants associated with quantitative traits that in turn affect disease risk. As exposure to high circulating estradiol and testosterone, and low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels is implicated in breast cancer etiology, we conducted GWAS analyses of plasma estradiol, testosterone, and SHBG to identify new susceptibility alleles. Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), and Sisters in Breast Cancer Screening data were used to carry out primary meta-analyses among {\~{}}1600 postmenopausal women who were not taking postmenopausal hormones at blood draw. We observed a genome-wide significant association between SHBG levels and rs727428 (joint $\beta$ = -0.126; joint P = 2.09×10-16), downstream of the SHBG gene. No genome-wide significant associations were observed with estradiol or testosterone levels. Among variants that were suggestively associated with estradiol (P{\textless}10-5), several were located at the CYP19A1 gene locus. Overall results were similar in secondary meta-analyses that included {\~{}}900 NHS current postmenopausal hormone users. No variant associated with estradiol, testosterone, or SHBG at P{\textless}10-5 was associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk among CGEMS participants. Our results suggest that the small magnitude of difference in hormone levels associated with common genetic variants is likely insufficient to detectably contribute to breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {Mouse models with cell-specific deletion of the estrogen receptor (ER) $\alpha$, the androgen receptor (AR) or the receptor activator of nuclear factor $\kappa$B ligand (RANKL), as well as cascade-selective estrogenic compounds have provided novel insights into the function and signalling of ER$\alpha$ and AR. The studies reveal that the effects of estrogens on trabecular versus cortical bone mass are mediated by direct effects on osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively. The protection of cortical bone mass by estrogens is mediated via ER$\alpha$, using a non-nucleus-initiated mechanism. By contrast, the AR of mature osteoblasts is indispensable for the maintenance of trabecular bone mass in male mammals, but not required for the anabolic effects of androgens on cortical bone. Most unexpectedly, and independently of estrogens, ER$\alpha$ in osteoblast progenitors stimulates Wnt signalling and periosteal bone accrual in response to mechanical strain. RANKL expression in B lymphocytes, but not T lymphocytes, contributes to the loss of trabecular bone caused by estrogen deficiency. In this Review, we summarize this evidence and discuss its implications for understanding the regulation of trabecular and cortical bone mass; the integration of hormonal and mechanical signals; the relative importance of estrogens versus androgens in the male skeleton; and, finally, the pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Background Sex hormones and gonadotropins exert a wide variety of effects in physiological and pathological processes. Accumulated evidence shows a strong heritable component of circulating concentrations of these hormones. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted in Caucasians have identified multiple loci that influence serum levels of sex hormones. However, the genetic determinants remain unknown in Chinese populations. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with major sex hormones, gonadotropins, including testosterone, oestradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in a Chinese population. Methods A two-stage GWAS was conducted in a total of 3495 healthy Chinese men (1999 subjects in the GWAS discovery stage and 1496 in the confirmation stage). Results We identified a novel genetic region at 15q21.2 (rs2414095 in CYP19A1), which was significantly associated with oestradiol and FSH in the Chinese population at a genome-wide significant level (p=6.54×10-31 and 1.59×10-16, respectively). Another single nucleotide polymorphism in CYP19A1 gene was significantly associated with oestradiol level (rs2445762, p=7.75×10-28). In addition, we confirmed the previous GWAS-identified locus at 17p13.1 for testosterone (rs2075230, p=1.13×10-8) and SHBG level (rs2075230, p=4.75×10-19) in the Chinese population. Conclusions This study is the first GWAS investigation of genetic determinants of FSH and LH. The identification of novel susceptibility loci may provide more biological implications for the synthesis and metabolism of these hormones. More importantly, the confirmation of the genetic loci for testosterone and SHBG suggests common genetic components shared among different ethnicities.},

abstract = {Oestrogen is considered to be the 'female' hormone, whereas testosterone is considered the 'male' hormone. However, both hormones are present in both sexes. Thus sexual distinctions are not qualitative differences, but rather result from quantitative divergence in hormone concentrations and differential expressions of steroid hormone receptors. In males, oestrogen is present in low concentrations in blood, but can be extraordinarily high in semen, and as high as 250 pg ml-1 in rete testis fluids, which is higher than serum oestradiol in the female. It is well known that male reproductive tissues express oestrogen receptors, but the role of oestrogen in male reproduction has remained unclear. Here we provide evidence of a physiological role for oestrogen in male reproductive organs. We show that oestrogen regulates the reabsorption of luminal fluid in the head of the epididymis. Disruption of this essential function causes sperm to enter the epididymis diluted, rather than concentrate, resulting in infertility. This finding raises further concern over the potential direct effects of environmental oestrogens on male reproduction and reported declines in human sperm counts.},

Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.74–0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobafile:///Users/dansc755/Downloads/s41591-019-0563-7.pdfnk cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95{\%} CI = 4.48–12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95{\%} CI = 1.98–3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.},

The use of oral contraceptives leads to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, of myocardial infarction, of stroke and of peripheral artery disease, the risks of which are highest during the first year of use. Women with coagulation abnormalities have a higher risk of venous thrombosis when they use oral contraceptives (or postmenopausal hormones) than women without these abnormalities. The risk of venous thrombosis is also higher for preparations containing desogestrel or gestodene (third-generation progestogens) than for those containing levonorgestrel (second-generation progestogens). A previous thrombosis as well as obesity also increase the risk of oral contraceptive-related thrombosis. Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of venous thrombosis, and has no beneficial, and possibly even a detrimental, effect on the risk of arterial disease.

abstract = {CONTEXT Steroid hormones are important regulators of physiological processes in humans and are under genetic control. A link to coronary artery disease (CAD) is supposed. OBJECTIVE Our main objective was to identify genetic loci influencing steroid hormone levels. As a secondary aim, we searched for causal effects of steroid hormones on CAD. DESIGN We conducted genome-wide meta-association studies for eight steroid hormones: cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), estradiol, and testosterone in two independent cohorts (LIFE-Adult, LIFE-Heart, maximum n = 7667), and progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and aldosterone in LIFE-Heart only (maximum n = 2070). All genome-wide significant loci were tested for sex interactions. Furthermore, we tested whether previously reported CAD single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with our steroid hormone panel and investigated causal links between hormone levels and CAD status using Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches. RESULTS We discovered 15 novel associated loci for 17-hydroxyprogesterone, progesterone, DHEAS, cortisol, androstenedione, and estradiol. Five of these loci relate to genes directly involved in steroid metabolism, that is, CYP21A1, CYP11B1, CYP17A1, STS, and HSD17B12, almost completing the set of steroidogenic enzymes with genetic associations. Sexual dimorphisms were found for seven of the novel loci. Other loci correspond, for example, to the WNT4/$\beta$-catenin pathway. MR revealed that cortisol, androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and DHEA-S had causal effects on CAD. We also observed enrichment of cortisol and testosterone associations among known CAD hits. CONCLUSION Our study greatly improves insight into genetic regulation of steroid hormones and their dependency on sex. These results could serve as a basis for analyzing sexual dimorphism in other complex diseases.},

We present HaploReg, a tool for exploring annotations of the non-coding genome among the results of published GWAS or novel sets of variants. Using LD information from the 1000 Genomes Project, linked SNPs and small indels can be visualized along with their predicted chromatin state in nine cell types, conservation across mammals and their effect on regulatory motifs. Sets of SNPs, such as those resulting from GWAS, are analyzed for an enrichment of cell type-specific enhancers.

We tested the top BMD-associated markers for replication in 50,933 independent subjects and for association with risk of low-trauma fracture in 31,016 individuals with a history of fracture (cases) and 102,444 controls. We identified 56 loci (32 new) associated with BMD at genome-wide significance (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8). Several of these factors cluster within the RANK-RANKL-OPG, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, endochondral ossification and Wnt signaling pathways. However, we also discovered loci that were localized to genes not known to have a role in bone biology. Fourteen BMD-associated loci were also associated with fracture risk (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -4, Bonferroni corrected), of which six reached P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8, including at 18p11.21 (FAM210A), 7q21.3 (SLC25A13), 11q13.2 (LRP5), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 2p16.2 (SPTBN1) and 10q21.1 (DKK1).

abstract = {The catalytic properties of CYP3A7 in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substrates were compared with those of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 using COS- 7 expressing enzymes. The highest activities of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (DHEA-S) 16$\alpha$-hydroxylase were observed in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A7. In contrast, the activity of testosterone 6$\beta$-hydroxylase of CYP3A7 expressed in COS-7 cells was much less than that of CYP3A4 expressed in COS-7 cells. The rate of carbamazepine 10,11-epoxidation was the greatest in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A4, followed by CYP3A5 and CYP3A7. On the other hand, the formation of reductive metabolite of zonisamide was the highest in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A4, followed by CYP3A7 and CYP3A5. Furthermore, the addition of triazolam resulted in a decrease in 6$\beta$-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP3A7, but not by CYP3A4, whereas the pretreatment of microsomes with triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) resulted in a decrease in the reaction catalyzed by CYP3A4, but not by CYP3A7. Together with these results, it was suggested that CYP3A7 exerts differential catalytic properties not only in metabolism of endogenous substrates but also in drug metabolism compared to CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.},

abstract = {There is a growing awareness that androgens and estrogens have general metabolic roles that are not directly involved in reproductive processes. These include actions on vascular function, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as bone mineralization and epiphyseal closure, in both sexes. In postmenopausal women, as in men, estrogen is no longer solely an endocrine factor, but instead is produced in a number of extragonadal sites and acts locally at these sites in a paracrine and intracrine fashion. These sites include breast, bone, vasculature, and brain. Within these sites, aromatase action can generate high levels of E2 locally without significantly affecting circulating levels. Circulating C19 steroid precursors are essential substrates for extragonadal estrogen synthesis. The levels of these androgenic precursors decline markedly with advancing age in women, possibly from the mid to late reproductive years. This may be a fundamental reason why women are at increased risk for bone mineral loss and fracture and possibly decline of cognitive function, compared with men. Aromatase expression in these various sites is under the control of tissue-specific promoters regulated by different cohorts of transcription factors. Thus, in principle, it should be possible to develop selective aromatase modulators that block aromatase expression, for example, in breast, but allow unimpaired estrogen synthesis in other tissues such as bone.},

abstract = {Polymorphism of the ABO blood group gene was investigated in 262 healthy Japanese donors by a polymerase chain reactions-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method, and 13 different alleles were identified. The number of alleles identified in each group was 4 for A1 (provisionally called ABO(*)A101, (*)A102, (*)A103 and (*)A104 according to the guidelines for human gene nomenclature), 4 for B (ABO(*)B101, (*)B102 and (*)B103), and 6 for O (ABO(*)O101, (*)O102, (*)O103, (*)O201, (*)O202 and (*)O203). Nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments with different SSCP patterns were determined by direct sequencing. Phylogenetic network analysis revealed that these alleles could be classified into three major lineages, (*)A/(*)O1, (*)B and (*)O2. In Japanese, (*)A102 and (*)B101 were the predominant alleles with frequencies of 83{\%} and 97{\%} in each group, respectively, whereas in group O, two common alleles, (*)O101 (43{\%}) and (*)O201 (53{\%}), were observed. These results may be useful for the establishment of ABO genotyping, and these newly described ABO alleles would be advantageous indicators for population studies.},

abstract = {Objective:The aim of the study was to quantify baseline estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) concentrations according to selected patient characteristics in a substudy nested within the MAP.3 chemoprevention trial.Methods:E2 and E1 levels were measured in 4,068 postmenopausal women using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Distributions were described by age, years since menopause, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and use and duration of hormone therapy using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multivariable linear regression was also used to identify characteristics associated with estrogen levels.Results:After truncation at the 97.5th percentile, the mean (SD)/median (IQR) values for E2 and E1 were 5.41 (4.67)/4.0 (2.4-6.7) pg/mL and 24.7 (14.1)/21 (15-31) pg/mL, respectively. E2 and E1 were strongly correlated (Pearson correlation [r] = 0.8, P {\textless} 0.01). The largest variation in E2 and E1 levels was by BMI; mean E2 and E1 levels were 3.5 and 19.1 pg/mL, respectively for women with BMI less than 25 and 7.5 and 30.6 pg/mL, respectively, for women with BMI greater than 30. E2 and E1 varied by age, BMI, smoking status, and prior hormone therapy in multivariable models (P {\textless} 0.01).Conclusions:There was large interindividual variability observed for E2 and E1 that varied significantly by participant characteristics, but with small absolute differences except in the case of BMI. Although the majority of participant characteristics were independently associated with E1 and E2, together, these factors only explained about 20{\%} of the variation in E1 and E2 levels.},

abstract = {Considerable experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated endogenous sex steroids - notably androgens and oestrogens - promote breast tumour development. In spite of this evidence, postmenopausal androgen replacement therapy with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or testosterone has been advocated for the prevention of osteoporosis and improved sexual well-being. We have conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Levels of DHEA sulphate (DHEAS), ($\Delta$4-androstenedione), testosterone, oestrone, oestradiol and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in prediagnostic serum samples of 677 postmenopausal women who subsequently developed breast cancer and 1309 matched control subjects. Levels of free testosterone and free oestradiol were calculated from absolute concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol and SHBG. Logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks of breast cancer by quintiles of hormone concentrations. For all sex steroids - the androgens as well as the oestrogens - elevated serum levels were positively associated with breast cancer risk, while SHBG levels were inversely related to risk. For the androgens, relative risk estimates (95{\%} confidence intervals) between the top and bottom quintiles of the exposure distribution were: DHEAS 1.69 (1.23-2.33), androstenedione 1.94 (1.40-2.69), testosterone 1.85 (1.33-2.57) and free testosterone 2.50 (1.76-3.55). For the oestrogens, relative risk estimates were: oestrone 2.07 (1.42-3.02), oestradiol 2.28 (1.61-3.23) and free oestradiol (odds ratios 2.13 (1.52-2.98)). Adjustments for body mass index or other potential confounding factors did not substantially alter any of these relative risk estimates. Our results have shown that, among postmenopausal women, not only elevated serum oestrogens but also serum androgens are associated with increased breast cancer risk. Since DHEAS and androstenedione are largely of adrenal origin in postmenopausal women, our results indicated that elevated adrenal androgen synthesis is a risk factor for breast cancer. The results from this study caution against the use of DHEA(S), or other androgens, for postmenopausal androgen replacement therapy. {\textcopyright} 2005 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.},

abstract = {Plasma estrogen and androgen levels are positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but how long a single blood measurement can predict risk and whether the associations vary by tumor hormone receptor status remain unclear. We conducted nested case–control analyses within the Nurses' Health Study. Blood samples were collected in 1989–1990 and again in 2000–2002. Among postmenopausal women not using postmenopausal hormones at blood collection, 707 cases were diagnosed through June 2010, with two matched controls per case. We used unconditional logistic regression analyses to estimate the relative risks controlling for other breast cancer risk factors. The intra-class correlation coefficients for two blood measurements collected 10 years apart ranged from 0.54 (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, DHEAS) to 0.74 (sex hormone-binding globulin, SHBG). Overall, women in the top (vs. bottom) 25 {\%} of levels of estradiol, free estradiol, testosterone, free testosterone, and DHEAS were at a 50–110 {\%} higher risk of breast cancer (p
                trend {\textless} 0.001). SHBG was inversely associated with risk (p
                trend = 0.004). RRs were similar when comparing cases diagnosed 1–10 versus 11–20 years (or 16–20 years) after blood collection (p
                interaction {\textgreater} 0.2). Except for DHEAS, the associations varied significantly by hormone receptor status (p
                heterogeneity ≤ 0.02). For example, the RRs (95 {\%} CIs) comparing the highest versus lowest quartile were 2.8 (2.0–4.0; p

abstract = {Background: Contrasting etiologic hypotheses about the role of endogenous sex steroids in breast cancer development among premenopausal women implicate ovarian androgen excess and progesterone deficiency, estrogen excess, estrogen and progesterone excess, and both an excess or lack of adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] or its sulfate [DHEAS]) as risk factors. We conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort to examine associations among premenopausal serum concentrations of sex steroids and subsequent breast cancer risk. Methods: Levels of DHEAS, ($\Delta$4-)androstenedione, testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in single prediagnostic serum samples from 370 premenopausal women who subsequently developed breast cancer (case patients) and from 726 matched cancer-free control subjects. Levels of progesterone, estrone, and estradiol were also measured for the 285 case patients and 555 matched control subjects who had provided information about the day of menstrual cycle at blood donation. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks of breast cancer by quartiles of hormone concentrations. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Increased risks of breast cancer were associated with elevated serum concentrations of testosterone (odds ratio [OR] for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.73, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.16 to 2.57; Ptrend =.01), androstenedione (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.56, 95{\%} CI = 1.05 to 2.32; Ptrend =.01), and DHEAS (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.48, 95{\%} CI = 1.02 to 2.14; Ptrend =.10) but not SHBG. Elevated serum progesterone concentrations were associated with a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer risk (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 0.61, 95{\%} CI = 0.38 to 0.98; Ptrend =.06). The absolute risk of breast cancer for women younger than 40 followed up for 10 years was estimated at 2.6{\%} for those in the highest quartile of serum testosterone versus 1.5{\%} for those in the lowest quartile; for the highest and lowest quartiles of progesterone, these estimates were 1.7{\%} and 2.6{\%}, respectively. Breast cancer risk was not statistically significantly associated with serum levels of the other hormones. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that elevated blood concentrations of androgens are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2005, all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Associations between circulating concentrations of oestrogens, progesterone, and androgens with breast cancer and related risk factors in premenopausal women are not well understood. We aimed to characterise these associations with a pooled analysis of data from seven studies. Methods: Individual participant data for prediagnostic sex hormone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were contributed from seven prospective studies. We restricted analyses to women who were premenopausal and younger than 50 years at blood collection, and to women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 years. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} CIs for breast cancer associated with hormone concentrations by conditional logistic regression in cases and controls matched for age, date of blood collection, and day of cycle, with stratification by study and further adjustment for cycle phase. We examined associations of hormones with risk factors for breast cancer in control women by comparing geometric mean hormone concentrations in categories of these risk factors, adjusted for study, age, phase of menstrual cycle, and body-mass index (BMI). All statistical tests were two-sided. Findings: We included data for up to 767 women with breast cancer and 1699 controls in the risk analyses. Breast cancer risk was associated with a doubling in concentrations of oestradiol (OR 1{\textperiodcentered}19, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}06-1{\textperiodcentered}35), calculated free oestradiol (1{\textperiodcentered}17, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}33), oestrone (1{\textperiodcentered}27, 1{\textperiodcentered}05-1{\textperiodcentered}54), androstenedione (1{\textperiodcentered}30, 1{\textperiodcentered}10-1{\textperiodcentered}55), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (1{\textperiodcentered}17, 1{\textperiodcentered}04-1{\textperiodcentered}32), testosterone (1{\textperiodcentered}18, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}35), and calculated free testosterone (1{\textperiodcentered}08, 0{\textperiodcentered}97-1{\textperiodcentered}21). Breast cancer risk was not associated with luteal phase progesterone (doubling in concentration OR 1{\textperiodcentered}00, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}92-1{\textperiodcentered}09), and adjustment for other factors had little effect on any of these ORs. Cross-sectional analyses in control women showed several associations of sex hormones with breast cancer risk factors. Interpretation: Circulating oestrogens and androgens are positively associated with the risk for breast cancer in premenopausal women.

abstract = {Ovarian cancer is still the deadliest of all gynecologic malignancies in women worldwide. This is attributed to two main features of these tumors, namely, i) a diagnosis at an advanced tumor stage, and, ii) the rapid onset of resistance to standard chemotherapy after an initial successful therapy with platin- and taxol-derivatives. Therefore, novel targets for an early diagnosis and better treatment options for these tumors are urgently needed. Epidemiological data show that induction and biology of ovarian cancer is related to life-time estrogen exposure. Also experimental data reveal that ovarian cancer cells share a number of estrogen regulated pathways with other hormone-dependent cancers, e.g. breast and endometrial cancer. However, ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the subtypes are quite different with respect to mutations, origins, behaviours, markers and prognosis and respond differently to standard chemotherapy. Therefore, a characterization of ovarian cancer subtypes may lead to better treatment options for the various subtypes and in particular for the most frequently observed high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. For this intention, further studies on estrogen-related pathways and estrogen formation in ovarian cancer cells are warranted. The review gives an overview on ovarian cancer subtypes and explains the role of estrogen in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, enzymes active to synthesize and metabolize estrogens are described and strategies to target these pathways are discussed.},

abstract = {Endometrial cancer is clearly a hormonally responsive tumor, with a critical role played by estrogens unopposed by progestins. Numerous epidemiologic studies have shown substantial risk increases associated with use of unopposed estrogens, especially among thin women. This risk, however, can be reduced if progestins are added to the therapy. The manner in which progestins are prescribed is a critical determinant of risk. Most studies show that women who have ever used progestins continuously ({\textgreater}25 days/months) are at somewhat reduced risk relative to non-users (meta-analysis relative risk, RR, based on observational studies = 0.78, 95 confidence intervals, CI, 0.72-0.86). The reduced risk in greatest among heavy women. In contrast, women who have ever used progestins sequentially for {\textless}10 days each month are at increased risk, with meta-analysis results showing on overall RR of 1.76 (1.51-2.05); in contrast, progestins given for 10-24 days/month appear unrelated to risk (RR = 1.07, 0.92-1.24). These risks were based on varying patterns of usage, with little information available regarding how endometrial cancer risk is affected by duration of use, type and/or dose of estrogen or progestin, or mode of administration. Effects may also vary by clinical characteristics (e.g., differences for Type I vs. II tumors). Further resolution of many of these relationships may be dependent on pooling data from multiple studies to derive sufficient power for subgroups of users. With changing clinical practices, it will be important for future studies to monitor a wide range of exposures and to account for divergent effects of different usage patterns.

abstract = {Oral contraceptive use has been suggested to influence the risk of breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study is to clarify the time-dependent effects between long-term oral contraceptive use and cancer risk. We performed an observational study in 256,661 women from UK Biobank, born between 1939 and 1970. Information on cancer diagnoses were collected from self-reported data and from national registers until March 2019. Cumulative risk of cancer over the timespan of the study, as measured by the OR, and instantaneous risk, as measured by the HR, were assessed using Logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. The odds were lower among ever users, compared with never users, for ovarian cancer [OR ¼ 0.72; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.65–0.81] and endometrial cancer (OR ¼ 0.68; 95{\%} CI, 0.62–0.75), an association that was stronger with longer use (P {\textless} 0.001). Increased odds were seen for breast cancer in women when limiting the follow-up to 55 years of age (OR ¼ 1.10; 95{\%} CI, 1.03–1.17), but not for the full timespan. We only found a higher HR for breast cancer in former users immediately (≤2 years) after discontinued oral contraceptive use (HR ¼ 1.55; 95{\%} CI, 1.06–2.28), whereas the protective association for ovarian and endometrial cancer remained significant up to 35 years after last use of oral contraceptives. Given the body of evidence presented in our study, we argue that oral contraceptives can dramatically reduce women's risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer, whereas their effect on lifetime risk of breast cancer is limited. Significance: These results enable women and physicians to make more informed decisions considering oral contraceptive use, thus constituting an important step toward personalized medicine.},

abstract = {Background Oral contraceptives have been used by hundreds of millions of women around the world. Important questions remain regarding the very long-term cancer risks that are associated with oral contraception. Despite previous research, important questions remain about the safety of these contraceptives: (1) How long do endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer benefits persist? (2) Does combined oral contraceptive use during the reproductive years produce new cancer risks later in life? (3) What is the overall balance of cancer among past users as they enter the later stages of their lives? Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the very long-term cancer risks or benefits associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives, including the estimated overall life-time balance. Study Design The 46,022 women who were recruited to the UK Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study in 1968 and 1969 were observed for up to 44 years. Directly standardized rates of specific and any cancer were calculated for “ever” and “never” users of combined oral contraceptives; data were standardized for age, parity, social class, and smoking. Attributable risk and preventive fraction percentages were calculated. Poisson regression that adjusted for the same variables was used to estimate incidence rate ratios between ever and never users and to examine effects by time since last oral contraceptive use. Results There were 4661 ever users with at least 1 cancer during 884,895 woman-years of observation and 2341 never users with at least 1 cancer during 388,505 woman-years of observation. Ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with reduced colorectal (incidence rate ratio, 0.81; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.66–0.99), endometrial (incidence rate ratio, 0.66; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.48–0.89), ovarian (incidence rate ratio, 0.67; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.50–0.89), and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer (incidence rate ratio, 0.74; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.58–0.94). An increased risk of lung cancer was seen only among ever users who smoked at recruitment. An increased risk of breast and cervical cancer that was seen in current and recent users appeared to be lost within approximately 5 years of stopping oral contraception, with no evidence of either cancer recurring at increased risk in ever users with time. There was no evidence of new cancer risks appearing later in life among women who had used oral contraceptives. Thus, the{\ldots}},

abstract = {Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1, and many common, mostly non-coding variants. However, much of the genetic contribution to breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry. We identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall breast cancer risk at P {\textless} 5 × 10-8. The majority of credible risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements, and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was 2-5-fold enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for particular transcription factor binding sites. These results provide further insight into genetic susceptibility to breast cancer and will improve the use of genetic risk scores for individualized screening and prevention.},

We then performed meta-analysis on the results for high-grade serous ovarian cancer with the results from analysis of 31,448 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 3,887 mutation carriers with EOC. This identified three additional susceptibility loci at 2q13, 8q24.1 and 12q24.31.

abstract = {Age atmenopause marks the end of a woman's reproductive life and its timing associates with risks for cancer, cardiovascular and bone disorders.GWAS and candidate gene studies conducted in women of European ancestry have identified 27 loci associated with age at men opause. The relevance of these loci to women of African ancestry has not been previously studied. We therefore sought to uncover additional menopause loci and investigate the relevance of European menopause loci by performing a GWAS meta-analysis in 6510 women with Africanancestry derivedfrom 11studies across the USA.We did not identify any additional loci significantly associated with age at men opause in African Americans.We replicated the associations between six lociandage at men opause (P-value {\textless} 0.05): AMHR2, RHBLD2, PRIM1, HK3/UMC1, BRSK1/TMEM150B and MCM8. In addition, associations of 14 loci are directionally consistent with previous reports. We provide evidence that genetic variants influencing reproductive traits identified in European populations are also important in women of African ancestry residing in USA. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014.

In addition to four known loci, we identified 13 loci newly associated with age at natural menopause (at P {\textless} 5 - 10 g8). Candidate genes located at these newly associated loci include genes implicated in DNA repair (EXO1, HELQ, UIMC1, FAM175A, FANCI, TLK1, POLG and PRIM1) and immune function (IL11, NLRP11 and PRRC2A (also known as BAT2)). Gene-set enrichment pathway analyses using the full GWAS data set identified exoDNase, NF-I °B signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction as biological processes related to timing of menopause. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {The master regulator of neuroendocrine differentiation, achaete-scute complex homolog 1 (ASCL1) defines a subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma. However, the mechanistic role of ASCL1 in lung tumorigenesis and its relation to the immune microenvironment is principally unknown. Here, the immune landscape of ASCL1-positive lung adenocarcinomas was characterized by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, ASCL1 was transduced in mouse lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and comparative RNA-sequencing and secretome analyses were performed. The effects of ASCL1 on tumorigenesis were explored in an orthotopic syngeneic transplantation model. ASCL1-positive lung adenocarcinomas revealed lower infiltration of CD8+, CD4+, CD20+, and FOXP3+ lymphocytes and CD163+ macrophages indicating an immune desert phenotype. Ectopic ASCL1 upregulated cyclin transcript levels, stimulated cell proliferation, and enhanced tumor growth in mice. ASCL1 suppressed secretion of chemokines, including CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL10, and CXCL16, indicating effects on immune cell trafficking. In accordance with lower lymphocytes infiltration, ASCL1-positive lung adenocarcinomas demonstrated lower abundance of CXCR3-and CCR6-expressing cells. In conclusion, ASCL1 mediates its tumor-promoting effect not only through cell-autonomous signaling but also by modulating chemokine production and immune responses. These findings suggest that ASCL1-positive tumors represent a clinically relevant lung cancer entity.},

abstract = {Objective This study evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage serous EOC. Methods Patients enrolled in GOG-172 and 182 who provided specimens for translational research and consent were included. Germline DNA was evaluated with the Illumina's HumanOMNI1-Quad beadchips and scanned using Illumina's iScan optical imaging system. SNPs with allele frequency {\textgreater} 0.05 and genotyping rate {\textgreater} 0.98 were included. Analysis of SNPs for PFS and OS was done using Cox regression. Statistical significance was determined using Bonferroni corrected p-values with genomic control adjustment. Results The initial GWAS analysis included 1,124,677 markers in 396 patients. To obtain the final data set, quality control checks were performed and limited to serous tumors and self-identified Caucasian race. In total 636,555 SNPs and 289 patients passed all the filters. The pre-specified statistical level of significance was 7.855e− 08. No SNPs met this criteria for PFS or OS, however, two SNPs were close to significance (rs10899426 p-2.144e−08) (rs6256 p-9.774e− 07) for PFS and 2 different SNPs were identified (rs295315 p-7.536e−07; rs17693104 p-7.734e−07) which were close to significance for OS. Conclusions Using the pre-specified level of significance of 1 × 10− 08, we did not identify any SNPs of statistical significance for OS or PFS, however several were close. The SNP's identified in this GWAS study will require validation and these preliminary findings may lead to identification of novel pathways and biomarkers.},

abstract = {We performed a scan for genetic variants associated with multiple phenotypes by comparing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 42 traits or diseases. We identified 341 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10{\%}) associated with multiple traits. Several loci are associated with multiple phenotypes; for example, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of the traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-transformed odds ratio (log OR) = 0.15, P = 2 × 10 {\^{a}} '12) and Parkinson disease (log OR = {\^{a}} '0.15, P = 1.6 × 10 {\^{a}} '7), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that have multiple genetic causes in common. For example, variants associated with increased risk of schizophrenia also tended to be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we developed a method to identify pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased body mass index causally increases triglyceride levels.},

abstract = {Background: Hormonal and reproductive factors contribute to the development of ovarian cancer, but few studies have examined associations between circulating estrogens and estrogen metabolites and ovarian cancer risk. We evaluated whether serum estrogens and estrogen metabolite levels are associated with ovarian cancer risk among postmenopausal women in a nested case-control study in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS). Methods: We selected all 169 eligible epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 412 matched controls from women enrolled in WHI-OS who were not using menopausal hormones at baseline. Baseline levels of 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites were measured via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Associations with ovarian cancer risk overall and stratified by histologic subtype (serous/nonserous) were analyzed using logistic regression. The mean time from serum collection to cancer diagnosis was 6.9 years. Results: Overall, we observed modest ovarian cancer risk associations among women with higher levels of estrone [OR (95{\%} confidence interval) quintile (Q)5 vs. Q1: 1.54 (0.82-2.90), Ptrend = 0.05], as well as 2-and 4-methoxyestrone metabolites [2.03 (1.06-3.88), Ptrend = 0.02; 1.86 (0.98-3.56), Ptrend = 0.01, respectively]. Associations of estrogens and estrogen metabolites varied substantially by histologic subtype. Associations with serous tumors were universally null, while estrone [2.65 (1.09-6.45), Ptrend = 0.01, Pheterogeneity = 0.04], unconjugated estradiol [2.72 (1.04-7.14), Ptrend = 0.03, Pheterogeneity = 0.02] and many of the 2-, 4-, and 16-pathway metabolites were positively associated with nonserous tumors. Conclusions: Our study provides novel molecular data showing an association of the parent estrogens and several estrogen metabolites with nonserous ovarian cancers. Impact: These findings further support the heterogeneous etiology of ovarian cancer.},

Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography, functional impact and disease association.},

abstract = {The GWAS Catalog delivers a high-quality curated collection of all published genome-wide association studies enabling investigations to identify causal variants, understand disease mechanisms, and establish targets for novel therapies. The scope of the Catalog has also expanded to targeted and exome arrays with 1000 new associations added for these technologies. As of September 2018, the Catalog contains 5687 GWAS comprising 71673 variant-trait associations from 3567 publications. New content includes 284 full P-value summary statistics datasets for genome-wide and new targeted array studies, representing 6 × 10 9 individual variant-trait statistics. In the last 12 months, the Catalog's user interface was accessed by 1/490000 unique users who viewed {\textgreater}1 million pages. We have improved data access with the release of a new RESTful API to support high-throughput programmatic access, an improved web interface and a new summary statistics database. Summary statistics provision is supported by a new format proposed as a community standard for summary statistics data representation. This format was derived from our experience in standardizing heterogeneous submissions, mapping formats and in harmonizing content. Availability: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/.},

Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes {\textgreater}99{\%} of SNP variants with a frequency of {\textgreater}1{\%} for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies.},

abstract = {Here we describe the SweGen data set, a comprehensive map of genetic variation in the Swedish population. These data represent a basic resource for clinical genetics laboratories as well as for sequencing-based association studies by providing information on genetic variant frequencies in a cohort that is well matched to national patient cohorts. To select samples for this study, we first examined the genetic structure of the Swedish population using high-density SNP-array data from a nation-wide cohort of over 10 000 Swedish-born individuals included in the Swedish Twin Registry. A total of 1000 individuals, reflecting a cross-section of the population and capturing the main genetic structure, were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Analysis pipelines were developed for automated alignment, variant calling and quality control of the sequencing data. This resulted in a genome-wide collection of aggregated variant frequencies in the Swedish population that we have made available to the scientific community through the website 
                  https://swefreq.nbis.se
                  
                . A total of 29.2 million single-nucleotide variants and 3.8 million indels were detected in the 1000 samples, with 9.9 million of these variants not present in current databases. Each sample contributed with an average of 7199 individual-specific variants. In addition, an average of 8645 larger structural variants (SVs) were detected per individual, and we demonstrate that the population frequencies of these SVs can be used for efficient filtering analyses. Finally, our results show that the genetic diversity within Sweden is substantial compared with the diversity among continental European populations, underscoring the relevance of establishing a local reference data set.},

abstract = {Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon, and not completely understood. We have developed a method, CNVnator, for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-depth (RD) analysis of personal genome sequencing. Our method is based on combining the established mean-shift approach with additional refinements (multiple-bandwidth partitioning and GC correction) to broaden the range of discovered CNVs. We calibrated CNVnator using the extensive validation performed by the 1000 Genomes Project. Because of this, we could use CNVnator for CNV discovery and genotyping in a population and characterization of atypical CNVs, such as de novo and multi-allelic events. Overall, for CNVs accessible by RD, CNVnator has high sensitivity (86{\%}-96{\%}), low false-discovery rate (3{\%}-20{\%}), high genotyping accuracy (93{\%}-95{\%}), and high resolution in breakpoint discovery ({\textless}200 bp in 90{\%} of cases with high sequencing coverage). Furthermore, CNVnator is complementary in a straightforward way to split-read and read-pair approaches: It misses CNVs created by retrotransposable elements, but more than half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not detected by split-read or read-pair. By genotyping CNVs in the CEPH, Yoruba, and Chinese-Japanese populations, we estimated that at least 11{\%} of all CNV loci involve complex, multi-allelic events, a considerably higher estimate than reported earlier. Moreover, among these events, we observed cases with allele distribution strongly deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, possibly implying selection on certain complex loci. Finally, by combining discovery and genotyping, we identified six potential de novo CNVs in two family trios. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Inherited genetic variation has a critical but as yet largely uncharacterized role in human disease. Here we report a public database of common variation in the human genome: more than one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269 DNA samples from four populations, including ten 500-kilobase regions in which essentially all information about common DNA variation has been extracted. These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours. We show how the HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic association studies, shed light on structural variation and recombination, and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during human evolution.},

abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy). Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples. Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies, which typically report regression coefficients summarizing the associations of many genetic variants with various traits, are potentially a powerful source of data for Mendelian randomization investigations. We demonstrate how such coefficients from multiple variants can be combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and efficiency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We investigate the impact of gene-gene interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and 'weak instruments' on these estimates. Both an inverse-variance weighted average of variant-specific associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least squares method for individual-level data, even when there are gene-gene interactions. However, these summarized data methods overstate precision when variants are in linkage disequilibrium. If the P-value in a linear regression of the risk factor for each variant is less than 1×10-5, then weak instrument bias will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on coronary artery disease using published data on five genetic variants. A 30{\%} reduction in LDL-C is estimated to reduce coronary artery disease risk by 67{\%} (95{\%} CI: 54{\%} to 76{\%}). We conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly efficient to those using individual-level data, although the necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed. {\textcopyright} 2013 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.},

abstract = {Developments in genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of summary genetic association data have made application of Mendelian randomization relatively straightforward. However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse-variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50{\%} of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better finite-sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse-variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed MR-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse-variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median-based and MR-Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},

abstract = {The detection of copy-number variations (CNVs) from NGS data is underexploited as chip-based or targeted techniques are still commonly used. We assessed the performances of a workflow centered on CANOES, a bioinformatics tool based on read depth information. We applied our workflow to gene panel (GP) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data, and compared CNV calls to quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMSPF) or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) results. From GP data of 3776 samples, we reached an overall positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.8{\%}. This dataset included a complete comprehensive QMPSF comparison of four genes (60 exons) on which we obtained 100{\%} sensitivity and specificity. From WES data, we first compared 137 samples with aCGH and filtered comparable events (exonic CNVs encompassing enough aCGH probes) and obtained an 87.25{\%} sensitivity. The overall PPV was 86.4{\%} following the targeted confirmation of candidate CNVs from 1056 additional WES. In addition, our CANOES-centered workflow on WES data allowed the detection of CNVs with a resolution of single exons, allowing the detection of CNVs that were missed by aCGH. Overall, switching to an NGS-only approach should be cost-effective as it allows a reduction in overall costs together with likely stable diagnostic yields.

abstract = {Objective Circulating testosterone, oestradiol and oestrone concentrations vary considerably between men. Although a substantial proportion of this variation may be attributed to morbidity and behavioural factors, these cannot account for its entirety, suggesting genetic inheritance as a potential additional determinant. The analysis described here was intended to estimate the heritability of male circulating total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (cFT), oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), along with the genetic correlation between these factors. Design Cross-sectional, observational analysis of data from male members of the Offspring and Generation 3 cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study. Data were collected in the years 1998-2005. Participants A total of 3367 community-dwelling men contributed to the analysis, including 1066 father/son and 1284 brother pairs among other family relationships. Measurements Levels of serum sex steroids (TT, E1 and E2) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, SHBG by immunofluorometric assay and cFT by mass action equation. Heritability was obtained using variance components analysis with adjustment for covariates including age, diabetes mellitus, body mass index and smoking status. Results Age-adjusted heritability estimates were 0{\textperiodcentered}19, 0{\textperiodcentered}40, 0{\textperiodcentered}40, 0{\textperiodcentered}30 and 0{\textperiodcentered}41 for cFT, TT, E1, E2 and SHBG, respectively. Adjustment for covariates did not substantially attenuate these estimates; SHBG-adjusted TT results were similar to those obtained for cFT. Genetic correlation coefficients ($\rho$G) indicated substantial genetic association between TT and cFT ($\rho$G = 0{\textperiodcentered}68), between TT and SHBG (pG = 0{\textperiodcentered}87), between E1 and E2 ($\rho$G = 0{\textperiodcentered}46) and between TT and E2 ($\rho$G = 0{\textperiodcentered}48). Conclusion Circulating testosterone, oestradiol and oestrone concentrations exhibit substantial heritability in adult men. Significant genetic association between testosterone and oestrogen levels suggests shared genetic pathways. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The complete assembly of each human chromosome is essential for understanding human biology and evolution1,2. Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric $\alpha$-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the $\beta$-defensin gene cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric $\alpha$-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order $\alpha$-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order $\alpha$-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric $\alpha$-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique portions of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence. The complete assembly of human chromosome 8 resolves previous gaps and reveals hidden complex forms of genetic variation, enabling functional and evolutionary characterization of primate centromeres.},

abstract = {Motivation: The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION is used for sequencing a wide variety of sample types with diverse methods of sample extraction. Nanopore sequencers output FAST5 files containing signal data subsequently base called to FASTQ format. Optionally, ONT devices can collect data from all sequencing channels simultaneously in a bulk FAST5 file enabling inspection of signal in any channel at any point. We sought to visualize this signal to inspect challenging or difficult to sequence samples. Results: The BulkVis tool can load a bulk FAST5 file and overlays MinKNOW (the software that controls ONT sequencers) classifications on the signal trace and can show mappings to a reference. Users can navigate to a channel and time or, given a FASTQ header from a read, jump to its specific position. BulkVis can export regions as Nanopore base caller compatible reads. Using BulkVis, we find long reads can be incorrectly divided by MinKNOW resulting in single DNA molecules being split into two or more reads. The longest seen to date is 2 272 580 bases in length and reported in eleven consecutive reads. We provide helper scripts that identify and reconstruct split reads given a sequencing summary file and alignment to a reference. We note that incorrect read splitting appears to vary according to input sample type and is more common in'ultra-long' read preparations.},

We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8{\%}) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5 kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91{\%} for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98{\%} for insertions and deletions {\textless}50 bp (indels) and 95.99{\%} for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the ‘genome in a bottle' (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64{\%}) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of {\textgreater}15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997{\%}, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.},

This can be a critical limitation when targeting regions that are highly repetitive or with extreme guanine–cytosine (GC) content, including repeat expansions associated with human disease. Here, we used an amplification-free protocol for targeted enrichment utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system (No-Amp Targeted sequencing) in combination with single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing for studying repeat elements in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, where an expanded CAG repeat is causative for Huntington disease. We also developed a robust data analysis pipeline for repeat element analysis that is independent of alignment of reads to a reference genome. The method was applied to 11 diagnostic blood samples, and for all 22 alleles the resulting CAG repeat count agreed with previous results based on fragment analysis. The amplification-free protocol also allowed for studying somatic variability of repeat elements in our samples, without the interference of PCR stutter. In summary, with No-Amp Targeted sequencing in combination with our analysis pipeline, we could accurately study repeat elements that are difficult to investigate using PCR-based methods.},

Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance. We provide Manta as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios.},

abstract = {Motivation: Structural variants are defined as genomic variants larger than 50 bp. They have been shown to affect more bases in any given genome than single-nucleotide polymorphisms or small insertions and deletions. Additionally, they have great impact on human phenotype and diversity and have been linked to numerous diseases. Due to their size and association with repeats, they are difficult to detect by shotgun sequencing, especially when based on short reads. Long read, single-molecule sequencing technologies like those offered by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies produce reads with a length of several thousand base pairs. Despite the higher error rate and sequencing cost, long-read sequencing offers many advantages for the detection of structural variants. Yet, available software tools still do not fully exploit the possibilities. Results: We present SVIM, a tool for the sensitive detection and precise characterization of structural variants from long-read data. SVIM consists of three components for the collection, clustering and combination of structural variant signatures from read alignments. It discriminates five different variant classes including similar types, such as tandem and interspersed duplications and novel element insertions. SVIM is unique in its capability of extracting both the genomic origin and destination of duplications. It compares favorably with existing tools in evaluations on simulated data and real datasets from Pacific Biosciences and Nanopore sequencing machines.},
