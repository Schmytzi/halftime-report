abstract = {Results: Variants in/near CYP19A1 demonstrated the strongest evidence for association with E2, resolving to three independent signals. Two additional independent signals were found on the X chromosome; FAMily with sequence similarity 9, member B (FAM9B), rs5934505 (P = 3.4 3 1028) and Xq27.3, rs5951794 (P = 3.1 3 10210). E1 signals were found in CYP19A1 (rs2899472, P = 5.5 3 10223), in Tripartite motif containing 4 (TRIM4; rs17277546, P = 5.8 3 10214), and CYP11B1/B2 (rs10093796, P = 1.2 3 1028). E2 signals in CYP19A1 and FAM9B were associated with bone mineral density (BMD). Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of serum E2 on BMD in men. A 1 pg/mL genetically increased E2 was associated with a 0.048 standard deviation increase in lumbar spine BMD (P = 2.8 3 10212). In men and women combined, CYP19A1 alleles associated with higher E2 levels were associated with lower degrees of insulin resistance. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that CYP19A1 is an important genetic regulator of E2 and E1 levels and strengthen the causal importance of E2 for bone health in men. We also report two independent loci on the X-chromosome for E2, and one locus each in TRIM4 and CYP11B1/B2, for E1.},

abstract = {We performed a discovery genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with variation in plasma estradiol (E2) concentrations using DNA from 772 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer prior to the initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy. Association analyses showed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1864729) with the lowest P value (P = 3.49E-08), mapped to chromosome 8 near TSPYL5. We also identified 17 imputed SNPs in or near TSPYL5 with P values {\textless} 5E-08, one of which, rs2583506, created a functional estrogen response element. We then used a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) stably transfected with ER$\alpha$ with known genome-wide SNP genotypes to demonstrate that TSPYL5 expression increased after E2 exposure of cells heterozygous for variant TSPYL5 SNP genotypes, but not in those homozygous for wild-type alleles. TSPYL5 knockdown decreased, and overexpression increased aromatase (CYP19A1) expression in MCF-7 cells, LCLs, and adipocytes through the skin/adipose (I.4) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that TSPYL5 bound to the CYP19A1 I.4 promoter. A putative TSPYL5 binding motif was identified in 43 genes, and TSPYL5 appeared to function as a transcription factor for most of those genes. In summary, genome-wide significant SNPs in TSPYL5 were associated with elevated plasma E2 in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. SNP rs2583506 created a functional estrogen response element, and LCLs with variant SNP genotypes displayed increased E2-dependent TSPYL5 expression. TSPYL5 induced CYP19A1 expression and that of many other genes. These studies have revealed a novel mechanism for regulating aromatase expression and plasma E2 concentrations in postmenopausal women with ER(+) breast cancer.},

abstract = {We propose here a new unitary model for the pathophysiology of involutional osteoporosis that identifies estrogen (E) deficiency as the cause of both the early, accelerated and the late, slow phases of bone loss in postmenopausal women and as a contributing cause of the continuous phase of bone loss in aging men. The accelerated phase in women is most apparent during the first decade after menopause, involves disproportionate loss of cancellous bone, and is mediated mainly by loss of the direct restraining effects of E on bone cell function. The ensuing slow phase continues throughout life in women, involves proportionate losses of cancellous and cortical bone, and is associated with progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism. This phase is mediated mainly by loss of E action on extraskeletal calcium homeostasis which results in net calcium wasting and increases in the level of dietary calcium intake required to maintain bone balance. Because elderly men have low circulating levels of both bioavailable E and bioavailable testosterone (T) and because recent data suggest that E is at least as important as T in determining bone mass in aging men, E deficiency may also contribute substantially to the continuous bone loss of aging men. In both genders, E deficiency increases bone resorption and may also impair a compensatory increase in bone formation. For the most part, this unitary model is well supported by observational and experimental data and provides plausible explanations to traditional objections to a unitary hypothesis.},

abstract = {Context. Estradiol is the primary female sex hormone and plays an important role for skeletal health in both sexes. Several enzymes are involved in estradiol metabolism but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to characterize the genetic contribution to variation in estrogen levels. Objective. Identify genetic loci affecting estradiol levels and estimate causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD). Design. We performed GWAS for estradiol in males (N = 147,690) and females (N = 163,985) from UK Biobank (UKB). Estradiol was analyzed as a binary phenotype; above/below detection limit (175 pmol/L). We further estimated the causal effect of estradiol on BMD using Mendelian randomization. Results. We identified 14 independent loci associated (P{\&}lt;5x10-8) with estradiol levels in males, of which one (CYP3A7) was genome-wide and seven nominally (P{\&}lt;0.05) significant in females. In addition, one female specific locus was identified. Most loci contain functionally relevant genes that have not been discussed in relation to estradiol levels in previous GWAS. For example, SRD5A2, which encodes a steroid 5-alpha reductase that is involved in processing androgens, and UGT3A1 and UGT2B7 which encode enzymes likely to be involved in estradiol elimination. The allele that tags the O blood group, at the ABO locus, was associated with higher estradiol levels. We identified a causal effect of high estradiol levels on increased BMD in both males (P=1.58x10-11) and females (P=7.48x10-6). Conclusion. Our findings further support the importance of the body{\&}{\#}039;s own estrogen to maintain skeletal health in males and in females.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe research was funded by the Swedish Research Council ({\AA}.J), the cancer foundation ({\AA}.J), the brain foundation ({\AA}.J), the {\AA} Wiberg (W.E.E), M Borgstr{\"{o}}m (W.E.E), Hedstr{\"{o}}ms, K och O F (W.E.E), A and M Rudbergs (W.E.E) foundations.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:UKB has an ethics permit from the National Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 11 / NW / 0382).

@article{Vikan2010,
abstract = {Objective: To study the impact of endogenous sex hormone levels in community-dwelling men on later risk for type 2 diabetes. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. Methods: For the analyses, 1454 men who participated in the fourth Troms{\o} study (1994-1995) were used. Cases of diabetes were retrieved and validated until 31.12.05 following a detailed protocol. The prospective association between sex hormones and diabetes was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, allowing for multivariate adjustments. Results: There was a significantly lowered multi-adjusted risk for later diabetes with higher normal total testosterone levels, both linearly per S.D. increase (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.92) and in the higher quartiles of total testosterone than in the lowest quartiles (HR 0.53, CI 0.33-0.84). A reduced multi-adjusted risk for incident diabetes was also found for men with higher sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, both linearly per S.D. increase (HR 0.55, CI 0.39-0.79) and when comparing the third (HR 0.38, CI 0.18-0.81) and the fourth quartile (HR 0.37, CI 0.17-0.82) to the lowest quartile. The associations with total testosterone and SHBG were no longer significant after inclusion of waist circumference to the multivariate models. Estradiol (E2) was positively associated with incident diabetes after multivariate adjustments including waist circumference when comparing the second (HR 0.49, CI 0.26-0.93) and the third (HR 0.51, CI 0.27-0.96) quartile to the highest quartile. Conclusion: Men with higher E2 levels had an increased risk of later diabetes independent of obesity, while men with lower total testosterone and SHBG had an increased risk of diabetes that appeared to be dependent on obesity. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Society of Endocrinology.},

abstract = {Testosterone supplementation is commonly used for its effects on sexual function, bone health and body composition, yet its effects on disease outcomes are unknown. To better understand this, we identified genetic determinants of testosterone levels and related sex hormone traits in 425,097 UK Biobank study participants. Using 2,571 genome-wide significant associations, we demonstrate that the genetic determinants of testosterone levels are substantially different between sexes and that genetically higher testosterone is harmful for metabolic diseases in women but beneficial in men. For example, a genetically determined 1 s.d. higher testosterone increases the risks of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 (95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 1.22–1.53)) and polycystic ovary syndrome (OR = 1.51 (95{\%} CI: 1.33–1.72)) in women, but reduces type 2 diabetes risk in men (OR = 0.86 (95{\%} CI: 0.76–0.98)). We also show adverse effects of higher testosterone on breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. Our findings provide insights into the disease impacts of testosterone and highlight the importance of sex-specific genetic analyses. Genetic analysis of data from over 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank Study shows that circulating testosterone levels have sex-specific implications for cardiometabolic diseases and cancer outcomes.},

abstract = {Context Observational studies indicate that serum estradiol (E2) is more strongly associated with bone mineral density (BMD) than serum testosterone (T) is, whereas both E2 and T associate with fracture risk in men. Objective To evaluate the possible causal effect of serum E2 and T on fracture risk in men. Design, Setting, and Participants A Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was undertaken using individual-level data on genotypes, BMD as estimated by quantitative ultrasound of the heel (eBMD), fractures (n = 17,650), and relevant covariates of 175,583 unrelated men of European origin from the UK Biobank. The genetic instruments for serum E2 and T were taken from the most recent large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analyses on these hormones in men. Results MR analyses demonstrated a causal effect of serum E2 on eBMD and fracture risk. A 1 SD (or 9.6 pg/mL) genetically instrumented decrease in serum E2 levels was associated with a 0.38 SD decrease in eBMD (P value: 9.7 × 10 -74) and an increased risk of any fracture (OR: 1.35; 95{\%} CI: 1.18, 1.55), nonvertebral major osteoporotic fractures (OR: 1.75; 95{\%} CI: 1.35, 2.27), and wrist fractures (OR: 2.27; 95{\%} CI: 1.62, 3.16). These causal effects of serum E2 levels on fracture risk were robust in sensitivity analyses and remained unchanged in stratified analyses for age, body mass index, eBMD, smoking status, and physical activity. MR analyses revealed no evidence of a causal effect of T levels on fracture risk. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence of a robust causal effect of serum E2, but not T, on fracture risk in men.},

@article{Cauley1999a,
abstract = {Background: The relation between endogenous steroid hormones and risk for breast cancer is uncertain. Measurement of sex hormone levels may identify women at high risk for breast cancer who should consider preventive therapies. Objective: To test the hypothesis that serum concentrations of estradiol and testosterone predict risk for breast cancer. Design: Prospective case-cohort study. Setting: Four clinical centers in the United States. Participants: 97 women with confirmed incident breast cancer and 244 randomly selected controls; all women were white, 65 years of age or older, and were not receiving estrogen. Measurements: Sex-steroid hormone concentrations were assayed by using serum that was collected at baseline and stored at -190 °C. Risk factors for breast cancer were ascertained by questionnaire. Incident cases of breast cancer were confirmed by review of medical records during an average period of 3.2 years. Results: The relative risk for breast cancer in women with the highest concentration of bioavailable estradiol (≥6.83 pmol/L or 1.9 pg/mL) was 3.6 (95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 10.0) compared with women with the lowest concentration. The risk for breast cancer in women with the highest concentration of free testosterone compared with those with the lowest concentration was 3.3 (CI, 1.1 to 10.3). The estimated incidence of breast cancer per 1000 person-years was 0.4 (CI, 0.0 to 1.3) in women with the lowest levels of bioavailable estradiol and free testosterone compared with 6.5 (CI, 2.7 to 10.3) in women with the highest concentrations of these hormones. Traditional risk factors for breast cancer were similar in case-patients and controls. Adjustments for these risk factors had little effect on the results. Conclusions: Estradiol and testosterone levels may play important roles in the development of breast cancer in older women. A single measurement of bioavailable estradiol and free testosterone may be used to estimate a woman's risk for breast cancer. Women identified as being at high risk for breast cancer as determined by these hormone levels may benefit from antiestrogen treatment for primary prevention.},

Here, we analysed high coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, to evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variants to 414 plasma proteins. The frequency distribution of genetic variants was skewed towards the rare spectrum, and damaging variants were more often rare. However, only 2.24{\%} of the heritability was estimated to be explained by rare variants. A gene-based approach, developed to also capture the effect of rare variants, identied associations for 249 of the proteins, which was 25{\%} more as compared to a GWAS. Out of those, 24 associations were driven by rare variants, clearly highlighting the capacity of aggregated tests and WGS data. We conclude that, while many rare variants have considerable phenotypic effects, their contribution to the missing heritability is limited by their low frequencies.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants that contribute to breast cancer risk. Discovering additional variants has become difficult, as power to detect variants of weaker effect with present sample sizes is limited. An alternative approach is to look for variants associated with quantitative traits that in turn affect disease risk. As exposure to high circulating estradiol and testosterone, and low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels is implicated in breast cancer etiology, we conducted GWAS analyses of plasma estradiol, testosterone, and SHBG to identify new susceptibility alleles. Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), and Sisters in Breast Cancer Screening data were used to carry out primary meta-analyses among {\~{}}1600 postmenopausal women who were not taking postmenopausal hormones at blood draw. We observed a genome-wide significant association between SHBG levels and rs727428 (joint $\beta$ = -0.126; joint P = 2.09×10-16), downstream of the SHBG gene. No genome-wide significant associations were observed with estradiol or testosterone levels. Among variants that were suggestively associated with estradiol (P{\textless}10-5), several were located at the CYP19A1 gene locus. Overall results were similar in secondary meta-analyses that included {\~{}}900 NHS current postmenopausal hormone users. No variant associated with estradiol, testosterone, or SHBG at P{\textless}10-5 was associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk among CGEMS participants. Our results suggest that the small magnitude of difference in hormone levels associated with common genetic variants is likely insufficient to detectably contribute to breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {Mouse models with cell-specific deletion of the estrogen receptor (ER) $\alpha$, the androgen receptor (AR) or the receptor activator of nuclear factor $\kappa$B ligand (RANKL), as well as cascade-selective estrogenic compounds have provided novel insights into the function and signalling of ER$\alpha$ and AR. The studies reveal that the effects of estrogens on trabecular versus cortical bone mass are mediated by direct effects on osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively. The protection of cortical bone mass by estrogens is mediated via ER$\alpha$, using a non-nucleus-initiated mechanism. By contrast, the AR of mature osteoblasts is indispensable for the maintenance of trabecular bone mass in male mammals, but not required for the anabolic effects of androgens on cortical bone. Most unexpectedly, and independently of estrogens, ER$\alpha$ in osteoblast progenitors stimulates Wnt signalling and periosteal bone accrual in response to mechanical strain. RANKL expression in B lymphocytes, but not T lymphocytes, contributes to the loss of trabecular bone caused by estrogen deficiency. In this Review, we summarize this evidence and discuss its implications for understanding the regulation of trabecular and cortical bone mass; the integration of hormonal and mechanical signals; the relative importance of estrogens versus androgens in the male skeleton; and, finally, the pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Background Sex hormones and gonadotropins exert a wide variety of effects in physiological and pathological processes. Accumulated evidence shows a strong heritable component of circulating concentrations of these hormones. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted in Caucasians have identified multiple loci that influence serum levels of sex hormones. However, the genetic determinants remain unknown in Chinese populations. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with major sex hormones, gonadotropins, including testosterone, oestradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in a Chinese population. Methods A two-stage GWAS was conducted in a total of 3495 healthy Chinese men (1999 subjects in the GWAS discovery stage and 1496 in the confirmation stage). Results We identified a novel genetic region at 15q21.2 (rs2414095 in CYP19A1), which was significantly associated with oestradiol and FSH in the Chinese population at a genome-wide significant level (p=6.54×10-31 and 1.59×10-16, respectively). Another single nucleotide polymorphism in CYP19A1 gene was significantly associated with oestradiol level (rs2445762, p=7.75×10-28). In addition, we confirmed the previous GWAS-identified locus at 17p13.1 for testosterone (rs2075230, p=1.13×10-8) and SHBG level (rs2075230, p=4.75×10-19) in the Chinese population. Conclusions This study is the first GWAS investigation of genetic determinants of FSH and LH. The identification of novel susceptibility loci may provide more biological implications for the synthesis and metabolism of these hormones. More importantly, the confirmation of the genetic loci for testosterone and SHBG suggests common genetic components shared among different ethnicities.},

abstract = {Oestrogen is considered to be the 'female' hormone, whereas testosterone is considered the 'male' hormone. However, both hormones are present in both sexes. Thus sexual distinctions are not qualitative differences, but rather result from quantitative divergence in hormone concentrations and differential expressions of steroid hormone receptors. In males, oestrogen is present in low concentrations in blood, but can be extraordinarily high in semen, and as high as 250 pg ml-1 in rete testis fluids, which is higher than serum oestradiol in the female. It is well known that male reproductive tissues express oestrogen receptors, but the role of oestrogen in male reproduction has remained unclear. Here we provide evidence of a physiological role for oestrogen in male reproductive organs. We show that oestrogen regulates the reabsorption of luminal fluid in the head of the epididymis. Disruption of this essential function causes sperm to enter the epididymis diluted, rather than concentrate, resulting in infertility. This finding raises further concern over the potential direct effects of environmental oestrogens on male reproduction and reported declines in human sperm counts.},

Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.74–0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobafile:///Users/dansc755/Downloads/s41591-019-0563-7.pdfnk cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95{\%} CI = 4.48–12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95{\%} CI = 1.98–3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.},

The use of oral contraceptives leads to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, of myocardial infarction, of stroke and of peripheral artery disease, the risks of which are highest during the first year of use. Women with coagulation abnormalities have a higher risk of venous thrombosis when they use oral contraceptives (or postmenopausal hormones) than women without these abnormalities. The risk of venous thrombosis is also higher for preparations containing desogestrel or gestodene (third-generation progestogens) than for those containing levonorgestrel (second-generation progestogens). A previous thrombosis as well as obesity also increase the risk of oral contraceptive-related thrombosis. Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of venous thrombosis, and has no beneficial, and possibly even a detrimental, effect on the risk of arterial disease.

abstract = {CONTEXT Steroid hormones are important regulators of physiological processes in humans and are under genetic control. A link to coronary artery disease (CAD) is supposed. OBJECTIVE Our main objective was to identify genetic loci influencing steroid hormone levels. As a secondary aim, we searched for causal effects of steroid hormones on CAD. DESIGN We conducted genome-wide meta-association studies for eight steroid hormones: cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), estradiol, and testosterone in two independent cohorts (LIFE-Adult, LIFE-Heart, maximum n = 7667), and progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and aldosterone in LIFE-Heart only (maximum n = 2070). All genome-wide significant loci were tested for sex interactions. Furthermore, we tested whether previously reported CAD single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with our steroid hormone panel and investigated causal links between hormone levels and CAD status using Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches. RESULTS We discovered 15 novel associated loci for 17-hydroxyprogesterone, progesterone, DHEAS, cortisol, androstenedione, and estradiol. Five of these loci relate to genes directly involved in steroid metabolism, that is, CYP21A1, CYP11B1, CYP17A1, STS, and HSD17B12, almost completing the set of steroidogenic enzymes with genetic associations. Sexual dimorphisms were found for seven of the novel loci. Other loci correspond, for example, to the WNT4/$\beta$-catenin pathway. MR revealed that cortisol, androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and DHEA-S had causal effects on CAD. We also observed enrichment of cortisol and testosterone associations among known CAD hits. CONCLUSION Our study greatly improves insight into genetic regulation of steroid hormones and their dependency on sex. These results could serve as a basis for analyzing sexual dimorphism in other complex diseases.},

We present HaploReg, a tool for exploring annotations of the non-coding genome among the results of published GWAS or novel sets of variants. Using LD information from the 1000 Genomes Project, linked SNPs and small indels can be visualized along with their predicted chromatin state in nine cell types, conservation across mammals and their effect on regulatory motifs. Sets of SNPs, such as those resulting from GWAS, are analyzed for an enrichment of cell type-specific enhancers.

We tested the top BMD-associated markers for replication in 50,933 independent subjects and for association with risk of low-trauma fracture in 31,016 individuals with a history of fracture (cases) and 102,444 controls. We identified 56 loci (32 new) associated with BMD at genome-wide significance (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8). Several of these factors cluster within the RANK-RANKL-OPG, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, endochondral ossification and Wnt signaling pathways. However, we also discovered loci that were localized to genes not known to have a role in bone biology. Fourteen BMD-associated loci were also associated with fracture risk (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -4, Bonferroni corrected), of which six reached P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8, including at 18p11.21 (FAM210A), 7q21.3 (SLC25A13), 11q13.2 (LRP5), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 2p16.2 (SPTBN1) and 10q21.1 (DKK1).

abstract = {The catalytic properties of CYP3A7 in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substrates were compared with those of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 using COS- 7 expressing enzymes. The highest activities of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (DHEA-S) 16$\alpha$-hydroxylase were observed in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A7. In contrast, the activity of testosterone 6$\beta$-hydroxylase of CYP3A7 expressed in COS-7 cells was much less than that of CYP3A4 expressed in COS-7 cells. The rate of carbamazepine 10,11-epoxidation was the greatest in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A4, followed by CYP3A5 and CYP3A7. On the other hand, the formation of reductive metabolite of zonisamide was the highest in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A4, followed by CYP3A7 and CYP3A5. Furthermore, the addition of triazolam resulted in a decrease in 6$\beta$-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP3A7, but not by CYP3A4, whereas the pretreatment of microsomes with triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) resulted in a decrease in the reaction catalyzed by CYP3A4, but not by CYP3A7. Together with these results, it was suggested that CYP3A7 exerts differential catalytic properties not only in metabolism of endogenous substrates but also in drug metabolism compared to CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.},

abstract = {There is a growing awareness that androgens and estrogens have general metabolic roles that are not directly involved in reproductive processes. These include actions on vascular function, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as bone mineralization and epiphyseal closure, in both sexes. In postmenopausal women, as in men, estrogen is no longer solely an endocrine factor, but instead is produced in a number of extragonadal sites and acts locally at these sites in a paracrine and intracrine fashion. These sites include breast, bone, vasculature, and brain. Within these sites, aromatase action can generate high levels of E2 locally without significantly affecting circulating levels. Circulating C19 steroid precursors are essential substrates for extragonadal estrogen synthesis. The levels of these androgenic precursors decline markedly with advancing age in women, possibly from the mid to late reproductive years. This may be a fundamental reason why women are at increased risk for bone mineral loss and fracture and possibly decline of cognitive function, compared with men. Aromatase expression in these various sites is under the control of tissue-specific promoters regulated by different cohorts of transcription factors. Thus, in principle, it should be possible to develop selective aromatase modulators that block aromatase expression, for example, in breast, but allow unimpaired estrogen synthesis in other tissues such as bone.},

abstract = {Polymorphism of the ABO blood group gene was investigated in 262 healthy Japanese donors by a polymerase chain reactions-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method, and 13 different alleles were identified. The number of alleles identified in each group was 4 for A1 (provisionally called ABO(*)A101, (*)A102, (*)A103 and (*)A104 according to the guidelines for human gene nomenclature), 4 for B (ABO(*)B101, (*)B102 and (*)B103), and 6 for O (ABO(*)O101, (*)O102, (*)O103, (*)O201, (*)O202 and (*)O203). Nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments with different SSCP patterns were determined by direct sequencing. Phylogenetic network analysis revealed that these alleles could be classified into three major lineages, (*)A/(*)O1, (*)B and (*)O2. In Japanese, (*)A102 and (*)B101 were the predominant alleles with frequencies of 83{\%} and 97{\%} in each group, respectively, whereas in group O, two common alleles, (*)O101 (43{\%}) and (*)O201 (53{\%}), were observed. These results may be useful for the establishment of ABO genotyping, and these newly described ABO alleles would be advantageous indicators for population studies.},

abstract = {Objective:The aim of the study was to quantify baseline estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) concentrations according to selected patient characteristics in a substudy nested within the MAP.3 chemoprevention trial.Methods:E2 and E1 levels were measured in 4,068 postmenopausal women using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Distributions were described by age, years since menopause, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and use and duration of hormone therapy using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multivariable linear regression was also used to identify characteristics associated with estrogen levels.Results:After truncation at the 97.5th percentile, the mean (SD)/median (IQR) values for E2 and E1 were 5.41 (4.67)/4.0 (2.4-6.7) pg/mL and 24.7 (14.1)/21 (15-31) pg/mL, respectively. E2 and E1 were strongly correlated (Pearson correlation [r] = 0.8, P {\textless} 0.01). The largest variation in E2 and E1 levels was by BMI; mean E2 and E1 levels were 3.5 and 19.1 pg/mL, respectively for women with BMI less than 25 and 7.5 and 30.6 pg/mL, respectively, for women with BMI greater than 30. E2 and E1 varied by age, BMI, smoking status, and prior hormone therapy in multivariable models (P {\textless} 0.01).Conclusions:There was large interindividual variability observed for E2 and E1 that varied significantly by participant characteristics, but with small absolute differences except in the case of BMI. Although the majority of participant characteristics were independently associated with E1 and E2, together, these factors only explained about 20{\%} of the variation in E1 and E2 levels.},

abstract = {Considerable experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated endogenous sex steroids - notably androgens and oestrogens - promote breast tumour development. In spite of this evidence, postmenopausal androgen replacement therapy with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or testosterone has been advocated for the prevention of osteoporosis and improved sexual well-being. We have conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Levels of DHEA sulphate (DHEAS), ($\Delta$4-androstenedione), testosterone, oestrone, oestradiol and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in prediagnostic serum samples of 677 postmenopausal women who subsequently developed breast cancer and 1309 matched control subjects. Levels of free testosterone and free oestradiol were calculated from absolute concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol and SHBG. Logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks of breast cancer by quintiles of hormone concentrations. For all sex steroids - the androgens as well as the oestrogens - elevated serum levels were positively associated with breast cancer risk, while SHBG levels were inversely related to risk. For the androgens, relative risk estimates (95{\%} confidence intervals) between the top and bottom quintiles of the exposure distribution were: DHEAS 1.69 (1.23-2.33), androstenedione 1.94 (1.40-2.69), testosterone 1.85 (1.33-2.57) and free testosterone 2.50 (1.76-3.55). For the oestrogens, relative risk estimates were: oestrone 2.07 (1.42-3.02), oestradiol 2.28 (1.61-3.23) and free oestradiol (odds ratios 2.13 (1.52-2.98)). Adjustments for body mass index or other potential confounding factors did not substantially alter any of these relative risk estimates. Our results have shown that, among postmenopausal women, not only elevated serum oestrogens but also serum androgens are associated with increased breast cancer risk. Since DHEAS and androstenedione are largely of adrenal origin in postmenopausal women, our results indicated that elevated adrenal androgen synthesis is a risk factor for breast cancer. The results from this study caution against the use of DHEA(S), or other androgens, for postmenopausal androgen replacement therapy. {\textcopyright} 2005 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.},

abstract = {Plasma estrogen and androgen levels are positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but how long a single blood measurement can predict risk and whether the associations vary by tumor hormone receptor status remain unclear. We conducted nested case–control analyses within the Nurses' Health Study. Blood samples were collected in 1989–1990 and again in 2000–2002. Among postmenopausal women not using postmenopausal hormones at blood collection, 707 cases were diagnosed through June 2010, with two matched controls per case. We used unconditional logistic regression analyses to estimate the relative risks controlling for other breast cancer risk factors. The intra-class correlation coefficients for two blood measurements collected 10 years apart ranged from 0.54 (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, DHEAS) to 0.74 (sex hormone-binding globulin, SHBG). Overall, women in the top (vs. bottom) 25 {\%} of levels of estradiol, free estradiol, testosterone, free testosterone, and DHEAS were at a 50–110 {\%} higher risk of breast cancer (p
                trend {\textless} 0.001). SHBG was inversely associated with risk (p
                trend = 0.004). RRs were similar when comparing cases diagnosed 1–10 versus 11–20 years (or 16–20 years) after blood collection (p
                interaction {\textgreater} 0.2). Except for DHEAS, the associations varied significantly by hormone receptor status (p
                heterogeneity ≤ 0.02). For example, the RRs (95 {\%} CIs) comparing the highest versus lowest quartile were 2.8 (2.0–4.0; p

abstract = {Background: Contrasting etiologic hypotheses about the role of endogenous sex steroids in breast cancer development among premenopausal women implicate ovarian androgen excess and progesterone deficiency, estrogen excess, estrogen and progesterone excess, and both an excess or lack of adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] or its sulfate [DHEAS]) as risk factors. We conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort to examine associations among premenopausal serum concentrations of sex steroids and subsequent breast cancer risk. Methods: Levels of DHEAS, ($\Delta$4-)androstenedione, testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in single prediagnostic serum samples from 370 premenopausal women who subsequently developed breast cancer (case patients) and from 726 matched cancer-free control subjects. Levels of progesterone, estrone, and estradiol were also measured for the 285 case patients and 555 matched control subjects who had provided information about the day of menstrual cycle at blood donation. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks of breast cancer by quartiles of hormone concentrations. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Increased risks of breast cancer were associated with elevated serum concentrations of testosterone (odds ratio [OR] for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.73, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.16 to 2.57; Ptrend =.01), androstenedione (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.56, 95{\%} CI = 1.05 to 2.32; Ptrend =.01), and DHEAS (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.48, 95{\%} CI = 1.02 to 2.14; Ptrend =.10) but not SHBG. Elevated serum progesterone concentrations were associated with a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer risk (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 0.61, 95{\%} CI = 0.38 to 0.98; Ptrend =.06). The absolute risk of breast cancer for women younger than 40 followed up for 10 years was estimated at 2.6{\%} for those in the highest quartile of serum testosterone versus 1.5{\%} for those in the lowest quartile; for the highest and lowest quartiles of progesterone, these estimates were 1.7{\%} and 2.6{\%}, respectively. Breast cancer risk was not statistically significantly associated with serum levels of the other hormones. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that elevated blood concentrations of androgens are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2005, all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Associations between circulating concentrations of oestrogens, progesterone, and androgens with breast cancer and related risk factors in premenopausal women are not well understood. We aimed to characterise these associations with a pooled analysis of data from seven studies. Methods: Individual participant data for prediagnostic sex hormone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were contributed from seven prospective studies. We restricted analyses to women who were premenopausal and younger than 50 years at blood collection, and to women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 years. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} CIs for breast cancer associated with hormone concentrations by conditional logistic regression in cases and controls matched for age, date of blood collection, and day of cycle, with stratification by study and further adjustment for cycle phase. We examined associations of hormones with risk factors for breast cancer in control women by comparing geometric mean hormone concentrations in categories of these risk factors, adjusted for study, age, phase of menstrual cycle, and body-mass index (BMI). All statistical tests were two-sided. Findings: We included data for up to 767 women with breast cancer and 1699 controls in the risk analyses. Breast cancer risk was associated with a doubling in concentrations of oestradiol (OR 1{\textperiodcentered}19, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}06-1{\textperiodcentered}35), calculated free oestradiol (1{\textperiodcentered}17, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}33), oestrone (1{\textperiodcentered}27, 1{\textperiodcentered}05-1{\textperiodcentered}54), androstenedione (1{\textperiodcentered}30, 1{\textperiodcentered}10-1{\textperiodcentered}55), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (1{\textperiodcentered}17, 1{\textperiodcentered}04-1{\textperiodcentered}32), testosterone (1{\textperiodcentered}18, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}35), and calculated free testosterone (1{\textperiodcentered}08, 0{\textperiodcentered}97-1{\textperiodcentered}21). Breast cancer risk was not associated with luteal phase progesterone (doubling in concentration OR 1{\textperiodcentered}00, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}92-1{\textperiodcentered}09), and adjustment for other factors had little effect on any of these ORs. Cross-sectional analyses in control women showed several associations of sex hormones with breast cancer risk factors. Interpretation: Circulating oestrogens and androgens are positively associated with the risk for breast cancer in premenopausal women.

abstract = {Ovarian cancer is still the deadliest of all gynecologic malignancies in women worldwide. This is attributed to two main features of these tumors, namely, i) a diagnosis at an advanced tumor stage, and, ii) the rapid onset of resistance to standard chemotherapy after an initial successful therapy with platin- and taxol-derivatives. Therefore, novel targets for an early diagnosis and better treatment options for these tumors are urgently needed. Epidemiological data show that induction and biology of ovarian cancer is related to life-time estrogen exposure. Also experimental data reveal that ovarian cancer cells share a number of estrogen regulated pathways with other hormone-dependent cancers, e.g. breast and endometrial cancer. However, ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the subtypes are quite different with respect to mutations, origins, behaviours, markers and prognosis and respond differently to standard chemotherapy. Therefore, a characterization of ovarian cancer subtypes may lead to better treatment options for the various subtypes and in particular for the most frequently observed high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. For this intention, further studies on estrogen-related pathways and estrogen formation in ovarian cancer cells are warranted. The review gives an overview on ovarian cancer subtypes and explains the role of estrogen in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, enzymes active to synthesize and metabolize estrogens are described and strategies to target these pathways are discussed.},

abstract = {Endometrial cancer is clearly a hormonally responsive tumor, with a critical role played by estrogens unopposed by progestins. Numerous epidemiologic studies have shown substantial risk increases associated with use of unopposed estrogens, especially among thin women. This risk, however, can be reduced if progestins are added to the therapy. The manner in which progestins are prescribed is a critical determinant of risk. Most studies show that women who have ever used progestins continuously ({\textgreater}25 days/months) are at somewhat reduced risk relative to non-users (meta-analysis relative risk, RR, based on observational studies = 0.78, 95 confidence intervals, CI, 0.72-0.86). The reduced risk in greatest among heavy women. In contrast, women who have ever used progestins sequentially for {\textless}10 days each month are at increased risk, with meta-analysis results showing on overall RR of 1.76 (1.51-2.05); in contrast, progestins given for 10-24 days/month appear unrelated to risk (RR = 1.07, 0.92-1.24). These risks were based on varying patterns of usage, with little information available regarding how endometrial cancer risk is affected by duration of use, type and/or dose of estrogen or progestin, or mode of administration. Effects may also vary by clinical characteristics (e.g., differences for Type I vs. II tumors). Further resolution of many of these relationships may be dependent on pooling data from multiple studies to derive sufficient power for subgroups of users. With changing clinical practices, it will be important for future studies to monitor a wide range of exposures and to account for divergent effects of different usage patterns.

abstract = {Oral contraceptive use has been suggested to influence the risk of breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study is to clarify the time-dependent effects between long-term oral contraceptive use and cancer risk. We performed an observational study in 256,661 women from UK Biobank, born between 1939 and 1970. Information on cancer diagnoses were collected from self-reported data and from national registers until March 2019. Cumulative risk of cancer over the timespan of the study, as measured by the OR, and instantaneous risk, as measured by the HR, were assessed using Logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. The odds were lower among ever users, compared with never users, for ovarian cancer [OR ¼ 0.72; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.65–0.81] and endometrial cancer (OR ¼ 0.68; 95{\%} CI, 0.62–0.75), an association that was stronger with longer use (P {\textless} 0.001). Increased odds were seen for breast cancer in women when limiting the follow-up to 55 years of age (OR ¼ 1.10; 95{\%} CI, 1.03–1.17), but not for the full timespan. We only found a higher HR for breast cancer in former users immediately (≤2 years) after discontinued oral contraceptive use (HR ¼ 1.55; 95{\%} CI, 1.06–2.28), whereas the protective association for ovarian and endometrial cancer remained significant up to 35 years after last use of oral contraceptives. Given the body of evidence presented in our study, we argue that oral contraceptives can dramatically reduce women's risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer, whereas their effect on lifetime risk of breast cancer is limited. Significance: These results enable women and physicians to make more informed decisions considering oral contraceptive use, thus constituting an important step toward personalized medicine.},

abstract = {Background Oral contraceptives have been used by hundreds of millions of women around the world. Important questions remain regarding the very long-term cancer risks that are associated with oral contraception. Despite previous research, important questions remain about the safety of these contraceptives: (1) How long do endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer benefits persist? (2) Does combined oral contraceptive use during the reproductive years produce new cancer risks later in life? (3) What is the overall balance of cancer among past users as they enter the later stages of their lives? Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the very long-term cancer risks or benefits associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives, including the estimated overall life-time balance. Study Design The 46,022 women who were recruited to the UK Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study in 1968 and 1969 were observed for up to 44 years. Directly standardized rates of specific and any cancer were calculated for “ever” and “never” users of combined oral contraceptives; data were standardized for age, parity, social class, and smoking. Attributable risk and preventive fraction percentages were calculated. Poisson regression that adjusted for the same variables was used to estimate incidence rate ratios between ever and never users and to examine effects by time since last oral contraceptive use. Results There were 4661 ever users with at least 1 cancer during 884,895 woman-years of observation and 2341 never users with at least 1 cancer during 388,505 woman-years of observation. Ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with reduced colorectal (incidence rate ratio, 0.81; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.66–0.99), endometrial (incidence rate ratio, 0.66; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.48–0.89), ovarian (incidence rate ratio, 0.67; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.50–0.89), and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer (incidence rate ratio, 0.74; 99{\%} confidence interval, 0.58–0.94). An increased risk of lung cancer was seen only among ever users who smoked at recruitment. An increased risk of breast and cervical cancer that was seen in current and recent users appeared to be lost within approximately 5 years of stopping oral contraception, with no evidence of either cancer recurring at increased risk in ever users with time. There was no evidence of new cancer risks appearing later in life among women who had used oral contraceptives. Thus, the{\ldots}},

abstract = {Candidate gene studies have reported CYP19A1 variants to be associated with endometrial cancer and with estradiol (E 2 ) concentrations. We analyzed 2937 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 6608 endometrial cancer cases and 37 925 controls and report the first genome wide-significant association between endometrial cancer and a CYP19A1 SNP (rs727479 in intron 2, P =4.8×10 −11 ). SNP rs727479 was also among those most strongly associated with circulating E 2 concentrations in 2767 post-menopausal controls ( P =7.4×10 −8 ). The observed endometrial cancer odds ratio per rs727479 A-allele (1.15, CI=1.11–1.21) is compatible with that predicted by the observed effect on E 2 concentrations (1.09, CI=1.03–1.21), consistent with the hypothesis that endometrial cancer risk is driven by E 2 . From 28 candidate-causal SNPs, 12 co-located with three putative gene-regulatory elements and their risk alleles associated with higher CYP19A1 expression in bioinformatical analyses. For both phenotypes, the associations with rs727479 were stronger among women with a higher BMI ( P interaction =0.034 and 0.066 respectively), suggesting a biologically plausible gene-environment interaction.},

abstract = {Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1, and many common, mostly non-coding variants. However, much of the genetic contribution to breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry. We identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall breast cancer risk at P {\textless} 5 × 10-8. The majority of credible risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements, and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was 2-5-fold enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for particular transcription factor binding sites. These results provide further insight into genetic susceptibility to breast cancer and will improve the use of genetic risk scores for individualized screening and prevention.},

We then performed meta-analysis on the results for high-grade serous ovarian cancer with the results from analysis of 31,448 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 3,887 mutation carriers with EOC. This identified three additional susceptibility loci at 2q13, 8q24.1 and 12q24.31.
