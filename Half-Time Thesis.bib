abstract = {Results: Variants in/near CYP19A1 demonstrated the strongest evidence for association with E2, resolving to three independent signals. Two additional independent signals were found on the X chromosome; FAMily with sequence similarity 9, member B (FAM9B), rs5934505 (P = 3.4 3 1028) and Xq27.3, rs5951794 (P = 3.1 3 10210). E1 signals were found in CYP19A1 (rs2899472, P = 5.5 3 10223), in Tripartite motif containing 4 (TRIM4; rs17277546, P = 5.8 3 10214), and CYP11B1/B2 (rs10093796, P = 1.2 3 1028). E2 signals in CYP19A1 and FAM9B were associated with bone mineral density (BMD). Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a causal effect of serum E2 on BMD in men. A 1 pg/mL genetically increased E2 was associated with a 0.048 standard deviation increase in lumbar spine BMD (P = 2.8 3 10212). In men and women combined, CYP19A1 alleles associated with higher E2 levels were associated with lower degrees of insulin resistance. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that CYP19A1 is an important genetic regulator of E2 and E1 levels and strengthen the causal importance of E2 for bone health in men. We also report two independent loci on the X-chromosome for E2, and one locus each in TRIM4 and CYP11B1/B2, for E1.},

abstract = {We performed a discovery genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors associated with variation in plasma estradiol (E2) concentrations using DNA from 772 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer prior to the initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy. Association analyses showed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1864729) with the lowest P value (P = 3.49E-08), mapped to chromosome 8 near TSPYL5. We also identified 17 imputed SNPs in or near TSPYL5 with P values {\textless} 5E-08, one of which, rs2583506, created a functional estrogen response element. We then used a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) stably transfected with ER$\alpha$ with known genome-wide SNP genotypes to demonstrate that TSPYL5 expression increased after E2 exposure of cells heterozygous for variant TSPYL5 SNP genotypes, but not in those homozygous for wild-type alleles. TSPYL5 knockdown decreased, and overexpression increased aromatase (CYP19A1) expression in MCF-7 cells, LCLs, and adipocytes through the skin/adipose (I.4) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that TSPYL5 bound to the CYP19A1 I.4 promoter. A putative TSPYL5 binding motif was identified in 43 genes, and TSPYL5 appeared to function as a transcription factor for most of those genes. In summary, genome-wide significant SNPs in TSPYL5 were associated with elevated plasma E2 in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. SNP rs2583506 created a functional estrogen response element, and LCLs with variant SNP genotypes displayed increased E2-dependent TSPYL5 expression. TSPYL5 induced CYP19A1 expression and that of many other genes. These studies have revealed a novel mechanism for regulating aromatase expression and plasma E2 concentrations in postmenopausal women with ER(+) breast cancer.},

abstract = {We propose here a new unitary model for the pathophysiology of involutional osteoporosis that identifies estrogen (E) deficiency as the cause of both the early, accelerated and the late, slow phases of bone loss in postmenopausal women and as a contributing cause of the continuous phase of bone loss in aging men. The accelerated phase in women is most apparent during the first decade after menopause, involves disproportionate loss of cancellous bone, and is mediated mainly by loss of the direct restraining effects of E on bone cell function. The ensuing slow phase continues throughout life in women, involves proportionate losses of cancellous and cortical bone, and is associated with progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism. This phase is mediated mainly by loss of E action on extraskeletal calcium homeostasis which results in net calcium wasting and increases in the level of dietary calcium intake required to maintain bone balance. Because elderly men have low circulating levels of both bioavailable E and bioavailable testosterone (T) and because recent data suggest that E is at least as important as T in determining bone mass in aging men, E deficiency may also contribute substantially to the continuous bone loss of aging men. In both genders, E deficiency increases bone resorption and may also impair a compensatory increase in bone formation. For the most part, this unitary model is well supported by observational and experimental data and provides plausible explanations to traditional objections to a unitary hypothesis.},

abstract = {Context. Estradiol is the primary female sex hormone and plays an important role for skeletal health in both sexes. Several enzymes are involved in estradiol metabolism but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to characterize the genetic contribution to variation in estrogen levels. Objective. Identify genetic loci affecting estradiol levels and estimate causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD). Design. We performed GWAS for estradiol in males (N = 147,690) and females (N = 163,985) from UK Biobank (UKB). Estradiol was analyzed as a binary phenotype; above/below detection limit (175 pmol/L). We further estimated the causal effect of estradiol on BMD using Mendelian randomization. Results. We identified 14 independent loci associated (P{\&}lt;5x10-8) with estradiol levels in males, of which one (CYP3A7) was genome-wide and seven nominally (P{\&}lt;0.05) significant in females. In addition, one female specific locus was identified. Most loci contain functionally relevant genes that have not been discussed in relation to estradiol levels in previous GWAS. For example, SRD5A2, which encodes a steroid 5-alpha reductase that is involved in processing androgens, and UGT3A1 and UGT2B7 which encode enzymes likely to be involved in estradiol elimination. The allele that tags the O blood group, at the ABO locus, was associated with higher estradiol levels. We identified a causal effect of high estradiol levels on increased BMD in both males (P=1.58x10-11) and females (P=7.48x10-6). Conclusion. Our findings further support the importance of the body{\&}{\#}039;s own estrogen to maintain skeletal health in males and in females.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe research was funded by the Swedish Research Council ({\AA}.J), the cancer foundation ({\AA}.J), the brain foundation ({\AA}.J), the {\AA} Wiberg (W.E.E), M Borgstr{\"{o}}m (W.E.E), Hedstr{\"{o}}ms, K och O F (W.E.E), A and M Rudbergs (W.E.E) foundations.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:UKB has an ethics permit from the National Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 11 / NW / 0382).

@article{Vikan2010,
abstract = {Objective: To study the impact of endogenous sex hormone levels in community-dwelling men on later risk for type 2 diabetes. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. Methods: For the analyses, 1454 men who participated in the fourth Troms{\o} study (1994-1995) were used. Cases of diabetes were retrieved and validated until 31.12.05 following a detailed protocol. The prospective association between sex hormones and diabetes was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, allowing for multivariate adjustments. Results: There was a significantly lowered multi-adjusted risk for later diabetes with higher normal total testosterone levels, both linearly per S.D. increase (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.92) and in the higher quartiles of total testosterone than in the lowest quartiles (HR 0.53, CI 0.33-0.84). A reduced multi-adjusted risk for incident diabetes was also found for men with higher sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, both linearly per S.D. increase (HR 0.55, CI 0.39-0.79) and when comparing the third (HR 0.38, CI 0.18-0.81) and the fourth quartile (HR 0.37, CI 0.17-0.82) to the lowest quartile. The associations with total testosterone and SHBG were no longer significant after inclusion of waist circumference to the multivariate models. Estradiol (E2) was positively associated with incident diabetes after multivariate adjustments including waist circumference when comparing the second (HR 0.49, CI 0.26-0.93) and the third (HR 0.51, CI 0.27-0.96) quartile to the highest quartile. Conclusion: Men with higher E2 levels had an increased risk of later diabetes independent of obesity, while men with lower total testosterone and SHBG had an increased risk of diabetes that appeared to be dependent on obesity. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Society of Endocrinology.},

abstract = {Testosterone supplementation is commonly used for its effects on sexual function, bone health and body composition, yet its effects on disease outcomes are unknown. To better understand this, we identified genetic determinants of testosterone levels and related sex hormone traits in 425,097 UK Biobank study participants. Using 2,571 genome-wide significant associations, we demonstrate that the genetic determinants of testosterone levels are substantially different between sexes and that genetically higher testosterone is harmful for metabolic diseases in women but beneficial in men. For example, a genetically determined 1 s.d. higher testosterone increases the risks of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 (95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 1.22–1.53)) and polycystic ovary syndrome (OR = 1.51 (95{\%} CI: 1.33–1.72)) in women, but reduces type 2 diabetes risk in men (OR = 0.86 (95{\%} CI: 0.76–0.98)). We also show adverse effects of higher testosterone on breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. Our findings provide insights into the disease impacts of testosterone and highlight the importance of sex-specific genetic analyses. Genetic analysis of data from over 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank Study shows that circulating testosterone levels have sex-specific implications for cardiometabolic diseases and cancer outcomes.},

abstract = {Context Observational studies indicate that serum estradiol (E2) is more strongly associated with bone mineral density (BMD) than serum testosterone (T) is, whereas both E2 and T associate with fracture risk in men. Objective To evaluate the possible causal effect of serum E2 and T on fracture risk in men. Design, Setting, and Participants A Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was undertaken using individual-level data on genotypes, BMD as estimated by quantitative ultrasound of the heel (eBMD), fractures (n = 17,650), and relevant covariates of 175,583 unrelated men of European origin from the UK Biobank. The genetic instruments for serum E2 and T were taken from the most recent large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analyses on these hormones in men. Results MR analyses demonstrated a causal effect of serum E2 on eBMD and fracture risk. A 1 SD (or 9.6 pg/mL) genetically instrumented decrease in serum E2 levels was associated with a 0.38 SD decrease in eBMD (P value: 9.7 × 10 -74) and an increased risk of any fracture (OR: 1.35; 95{\%} CI: 1.18, 1.55), nonvertebral major osteoporotic fractures (OR: 1.75; 95{\%} CI: 1.35, 2.27), and wrist fractures (OR: 2.27; 95{\%} CI: 1.62, 3.16). These causal effects of serum E2 levels on fracture risk were robust in sensitivity analyses and remained unchanged in stratified analyses for age, body mass index, eBMD, smoking status, and physical activity. MR analyses revealed no evidence of a causal effect of T levels on fracture risk. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence of a robust causal effect of serum E2, but not T, on fracture risk in men.},

@article{Cauley1999a,
abstract = {Background: The relation between endogenous steroid hormones and risk for breast cancer is uncertain. Measurement of sex hormone levels may identify women at high risk for breast cancer who should consider preventive therapies. Objective: To test the hypothesis that serum concentrations of estradiol and testosterone predict risk for breast cancer. Design: Prospective case-cohort study. Setting: Four clinical centers in the United States. Participants: 97 women with confirmed incident breast cancer and 244 randomly selected controls; all women were white, 65 years of age or older, and were not receiving estrogen. Measurements: Sex-steroid hormone concentrations were assayed by using serum that was collected at baseline and stored at -190 °C. Risk factors for breast cancer were ascertained by questionnaire. Incident cases of breast cancer were confirmed by review of medical records during an average period of 3.2 years. Results: The relative risk for breast cancer in women with the highest concentration of bioavailable estradiol (≥6.83 pmol/L or 1.9 pg/mL) was 3.6 (95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 10.0) compared with women with the lowest concentration. The risk for breast cancer in women with the highest concentration of free testosterone compared with those with the lowest concentration was 3.3 (CI, 1.1 to 10.3). The estimated incidence of breast cancer per 1000 person-years was 0.4 (CI, 0.0 to 1.3) in women with the lowest levels of bioavailable estradiol and free testosterone compared with 6.5 (CI, 2.7 to 10.3) in women with the highest concentrations of these hormones. Traditional risk factors for breast cancer were similar in case-patients and controls. Adjustments for these risk factors had little effect on the results. Conclusions: Estradiol and testosterone levels may play important roles in the development of breast cancer in older women. A single measurement of bioavailable estradiol and free testosterone may be used to estimate a woman's risk for breast cancer. Women identified as being at high risk for breast cancer as determined by these hormone levels may benefit from antiestrogen treatment for primary prevention.},

Here, we analysed high coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, to evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variants to 414 plasma proteins. The frequency distribution of genetic variants was skewed towards the rare spectrum, and damaging variants were more often rare. However, only 2.24{\%} of the heritability was estimated to be explained by rare variants. A gene-based approach, developed to also capture the effect of rare variants, identied associations for 249 of the proteins, which was 25{\%} more as compared to a GWAS. Out of those, 24 associations were driven by rare variants, clearly highlighting the capacity of aggregated tests and WGS data. We conclude that, while many rare variants have considerable phenotypic effects, their contribution to the missing heritability is limited by their low frequencies.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common genetic variants that contribute to breast cancer risk. Discovering additional variants has become difficult, as power to detect variants of weaker effect with present sample sizes is limited. An alternative approach is to look for variants associated with quantitative traits that in turn affect disease risk. As exposure to high circulating estradiol and testosterone, and low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels is implicated in breast cancer etiology, we conducted GWAS analyses of plasma estradiol, testosterone, and SHBG to identify new susceptibility alleles. Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), and Sisters in Breast Cancer Screening data were used to carry out primary meta-analyses among {\~{}}1600 postmenopausal women who were not taking postmenopausal hormones at blood draw. We observed a genome-wide significant association between SHBG levels and rs727428 (joint $\beta$ = -0.126; joint P = 2.09×10-16), downstream of the SHBG gene. No genome-wide significant associations were observed with estradiol or testosterone levels. Among variants that were suggestively associated with estradiol (P{\textless}10-5), several were located at the CYP19A1 gene locus. Overall results were similar in secondary meta-analyses that included {\~{}}900 NHS current postmenopausal hormone users. No variant associated with estradiol, testosterone, or SHBG at P{\textless}10-5 was associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk among CGEMS participants. Our results suggest that the small magnitude of difference in hormone levels associated with common genetic variants is likely insufficient to detectably contribute to breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {Mouse models with cell-specific deletion of the estrogen receptor (ER) $\alpha$, the androgen receptor (AR) or the receptor activator of nuclear factor $\kappa$B ligand (RANKL), as well as cascade-selective estrogenic compounds have provided novel insights into the function and signalling of ER$\alpha$ and AR. The studies reveal that the effects of estrogens on trabecular versus cortical bone mass are mediated by direct effects on osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively. The protection of cortical bone mass by estrogens is mediated via ER$\alpha$, using a non-nucleus-initiated mechanism. By contrast, the AR of mature osteoblasts is indispensable for the maintenance of trabecular bone mass in male mammals, but not required for the anabolic effects of androgens on cortical bone. Most unexpectedly, and independently of estrogens, ER$\alpha$ in osteoblast progenitors stimulates Wnt signalling and periosteal bone accrual in response to mechanical strain. RANKL expression in B lymphocytes, but not T lymphocytes, contributes to the loss of trabecular bone caused by estrogen deficiency. In this Review, we summarize this evidence and discuss its implications for understanding the regulation of trabecular and cortical bone mass; the integration of hormonal and mechanical signals; the relative importance of estrogens versus androgens in the male skeleton; and, finally, the pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Background Sex hormones and gonadotropins exert a wide variety of effects in physiological and pathological processes. Accumulated evidence shows a strong heritable component of circulating concentrations of these hormones. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted in Caucasians have identified multiple loci that influence serum levels of sex hormones. However, the genetic determinants remain unknown in Chinese populations. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with major sex hormones, gonadotropins, including testosterone, oestradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in a Chinese population. Methods A two-stage GWAS was conducted in a total of 3495 healthy Chinese men (1999 subjects in the GWAS discovery stage and 1496 in the confirmation stage). Results We identified a novel genetic region at 15q21.2 (rs2414095 in CYP19A1), which was significantly associated with oestradiol and FSH in the Chinese population at a genome-wide significant level (p=6.54×10-31 and 1.59×10-16, respectively). Another single nucleotide polymorphism in CYP19A1 gene was significantly associated with oestradiol level (rs2445762, p=7.75×10-28). In addition, we confirmed the previous GWAS-identified locus at 17p13.1 for testosterone (rs2075230, p=1.13×10-8) and SHBG level (rs2075230, p=4.75×10-19) in the Chinese population. Conclusions This study is the first GWAS investigation of genetic determinants of FSH and LH. The identification of novel susceptibility loci may provide more biological implications for the synthesis and metabolism of these hormones. More importantly, the confirmation of the genetic loci for testosterone and SHBG suggests common genetic components shared among different ethnicities.},

abstract = {Oestrogen is considered to be the 'female' hormone, whereas testosterone is considered the 'male' hormone. However, both hormones are present in both sexes. Thus sexual distinctions are not qualitative differences, but rather result from quantitative divergence in hormone concentrations and differential expressions of steroid hormone receptors. In males, oestrogen is present in low concentrations in blood, but can be extraordinarily high in semen, and as high as 250 pg ml-1 in rete testis fluids, which is higher than serum oestradiol in the female. It is well known that male reproductive tissues express oestrogen receptors, but the role of oestrogen in male reproduction has remained unclear. Here we provide evidence of a physiological role for oestrogen in male reproductive organs. We show that oestrogen regulates the reabsorption of luminal fluid in the head of the epididymis. Disruption of this essential function causes sperm to enter the epididymis diluted, rather than concentrate, resulting in infertility. This finding raises further concern over the potential direct effects of environmental oestrogens on male reproduction and reported declines in human sperm counts.},

Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.74–0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobafile:///Users/dansc755/Downloads/s41591-019-0563-7.pdfnk cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95{\%} CI = 4.48–12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95{\%} CI = 1.98–3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.},

The use of oral contraceptives leads to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, of myocardial infarction, of stroke and of peripheral artery disease, the risks of which are highest during the first year of use. Women with coagulation abnormalities have a higher risk of venous thrombosis when they use oral contraceptives (or postmenopausal hormones) than women without these abnormalities. The risk of venous thrombosis is also higher for preparations containing desogestrel or gestodene (third-generation progestogens) than for those containing levonorgestrel (second-generation progestogens). A previous thrombosis as well as obesity also increase the risk of oral contraceptive-related thrombosis. Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of venous thrombosis, and has no beneficial, and possibly even a detrimental, effect on the risk of arterial disease.

abstract = {CONTEXT Steroid hormones are important regulators of physiological processes in humans and are under genetic control. A link to coronary artery disease (CAD) is supposed. OBJECTIVE Our main objective was to identify genetic loci influencing steroid hormone levels. As a secondary aim, we searched for causal effects of steroid hormones on CAD. DESIGN We conducted genome-wide meta-association studies for eight steroid hormones: cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), estradiol, and testosterone in two independent cohorts (LIFE-Adult, LIFE-Heart, maximum n = 7667), and progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and aldosterone in LIFE-Heart only (maximum n = 2070). All genome-wide significant loci were tested for sex interactions. Furthermore, we tested whether previously reported CAD single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with our steroid hormone panel and investigated causal links between hormone levels and CAD status using Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches. RESULTS We discovered 15 novel associated loci for 17-hydroxyprogesterone, progesterone, DHEAS, cortisol, androstenedione, and estradiol. Five of these loci relate to genes directly involved in steroid metabolism, that is, CYP21A1, CYP11B1, CYP17A1, STS, and HSD17B12, almost completing the set of steroidogenic enzymes with genetic associations. Sexual dimorphisms were found for seven of the novel loci. Other loci correspond, for example, to the WNT4/$\beta$-catenin pathway. MR revealed that cortisol, androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and DHEA-S had causal effects on CAD. We also observed enrichment of cortisol and testosterone associations among known CAD hits. CONCLUSION Our study greatly improves insight into genetic regulation of steroid hormones and their dependency on sex. These results could serve as a basis for analyzing sexual dimorphism in other complex diseases.},

We present HaploReg, a tool for exploring annotations of the non-coding genome among the results of published GWAS or novel sets of variants. Using LD information from the 1000 Genomes Project, linked SNPs and small indels can be visualized along with their predicted chromatin state in nine cell types, conservation across mammals and their effect on regulatory motifs. Sets of SNPs, such as those resulting from GWAS, are analyzed for an enrichment of cell type-specific enhancers.

We tested the top BMD-associated markers for replication in 50,933 independent subjects and for association with risk of low-trauma fracture in 31,016 individuals with a history of fracture (cases) and 102,444 controls. We identified 56 loci (32 new) associated with BMD at genome-wide significance (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8). Several of these factors cluster within the RANK-RANKL-OPG, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, endochondral ossification and Wnt signaling pathways. However, we also discovered loci that were localized to genes not known to have a role in bone biology. Fourteen BMD-associated loci were also associated with fracture risk (P {\textless} 5 × 10 -4, Bonferroni corrected), of which six reached P {\textless} 5 × 10 -8, including at 18p11.21 (FAM210A), 7q21.3 (SLC25A13), 11q13.2 (LRP5), 4q22.1 (MEPE), 2p16.2 (SPTBN1) and 10q21.1 (DKK1).

@article{Ohmori1998,
abstract = {The catalytic properties of CYP3A7 in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substrates were compared with those of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 using COS- 7 expressing enzymes. The highest activities of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (DHEA-S) 16$\alpha$-hydroxylase were observed in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A7. In contrast, the activity of testosterone 6$\beta$-hydroxylase of CYP3A7 expressed in COS-7 cells was much less than that of CYP3A4 expressed in COS-7 cells. The rate of carbamazepine 10,11-epoxidation was the greatest in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A4, followed by CYP3A5 and CYP3A7. On the other hand, the formation of reductive metabolite of zonisamide was the highest in COS-7 cells expressing CYP3A4, followed by CYP3A7 and CYP3A5. Furthermore, the addition of triazolam resulted in a decrease in 6$\beta$-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP3A7, but not by CYP3A4, whereas the pretreatment of microsomes with triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) resulted in a decrease in the reaction catalyzed by CYP3A4, but not by CYP3A7. Together with these results, it was suggested that CYP3A7 exerts differential catalytic properties not only in metabolism of endogenous substrates but also in drug metabolism compared to CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.},

@article{Simpson2001,
abstract = {There is a growing awareness that androgens and estrogens have general metabolic roles that are not directly involved in reproductive processes. These include actions on vascular function, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as bone mineralization and epiphyseal closure, in both sexes. In postmenopausal women, as in men, estrogen is no longer solely an endocrine factor, but instead is produced in a number of extragonadal sites and acts locally at these sites in a paracrine and intracrine fashion. These sites include breast, bone, vasculature, and brain. Within these sites, aromatase action can generate high levels of E2 locally without significantly affecting circulating levels. Circulating C19 steroid precursors are essential substrates for extragonadal estrogen synthesis. The levels of these androgenic precursors decline markedly with advancing age in women, possibly from the mid to late reproductive years. This may be a fundamental reason why women are at increased risk for bone mineral loss and fracture and possibly decline of cognitive function, compared with men. Aromatase expression in these various sites is under the control of tissue-specific promoters regulated by different cohorts of transcription factors. Thus, in principle, it should be possible to develop selective aromatase modulators that block aromatase expression, for example, in breast, but allow unimpaired estrogen synthesis in other tissues such as bone.},
